# The Rational Consitution

A modern constitutional framework built on realism about human nature.

This project proposes a minimal, adaptive system of governance that assumes self-interest, designs for corruption, and turns ambition into public good through transparency, decentralization, and feedback.

## Core Principles

1. **The Externality Principle**  
   All harm must be priced. Activities that impose measurable costs on others internalize those costs through market-based mechanisms. Revenues return to citizens or reduce baseline taxes.

2. **The Public Goods Principle**  
   All citizens share in shaping the future. A portion of public funds is allocated through open, participatory funding—rewarding broadly supported projects and civic innovation.

3. **Checks, Balances, and Transparency**  
   Power is divided and audited by independent, rival institutions. Governance is open by default; secrecy is an exception requiring justification.

4. **Adaptive Self-Correction**  
   Laws, institutions, and taxes automatically sunset, review, or adjust according to measurable outcomes. The system learns without revolution.

## Repository Structure

- `constitution.md` – core constitutional text (modular sections).  
- `acts/` – implementing documents (e.g., Externality Pricing Act, Civic Funding Act).  
- `docs/` – rationale, comparative analysis, and design notes.

## Contributing

Ideas, critiques, and comparative models are welcome.  
Pull requests should aim for clarity, minimalism, and testable governance mechanisms.
