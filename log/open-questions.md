# Open Questions — Civic Mandate Republic

1. **Judicial balance** — Should constitutional rights evolve via citizen referendum or remain static?  
2. **Military command** — How should emergency defense authority be structured under a limited executive?  
3. **Metric complexity** — How to ensure comprehensibility for the lay public?  
4. **Bureaucratic incentives** — How to avoid risk-averse stagnation among policymakers?  
5. **Local experimentation** — Should municipalities have independent Mandate systems?  
6. **Legacy institutions** — How to transition from political to mandate-based governance?  
7. **Cultural factors** — Would this model thrive universally, or only in high-trust societies?  
8. **Human psychology** — How to maintain meaning and identity when leadership is depersonalized?  
9. **Inter-Mandate conflicts** — What arbitration mechanisms are needed?  
10. **Technological transparency** — Could verifiable computation and cryptographic audits replace trust entirely?

- The mandate system removes an entire class of dark inventive: political power. Is there ANY left? Executive branch? Departments like the police or justice system? The chancellor? The policymakers? If so, how do we check and balance it or remove the incentive altogether?
  - Executive Council membership lacks measurable criteria (no audit metric for “nonpartisan experts” or selection/rotation cadence).
  - Define quantitative standards for Executive Council appointment, evaluation, and removal; ensure Civic Outcomes Ledger specifies governing body responsible for metric upkeep.

- AI: I do want to write this constitution assuming that AI doesn't exist but keep exploring how we could allow AI to exist within the framework or the possible benefits for instance you can massively ramp up the amount of triple verification and auditing and stuff like that automatic data collection with AI especially for things that would typically slow down government way too much like having auditing essentially that that would slow a lot of things to crawl so nothing would ever get done too much would be absorbed into bureaucracy but with AI it could be basically automatic

- Corporate checks and balances: Check my constitution to verify that there are proper checks on corporation so I'm not sure if that's explicit enough

- Pure Mandates: CAN pure mandates work with all the categories of legislation? How does it with with regular govt defines and health care and education and stuff ?

- Finish constitution (civic and mandates) and triple check for misaligned incentives. Core tenets: take into account human nature, directly vote for mandates, incentivize positively everywhere, harness natural incentives for positivity everywhere possible (eg free markets), radical transparency, checks and balances on power. Has this been tried? When/where/result? Is there anything (tech?) that kept it from being implemented in the past?

- Do policy crafters need to be a licensed profession? Why? Weigh the cost/benefits of the system vs simply an open application. If the mandates and data are completely open, does this even need to be a Bureau, or could it just be open to the general public to submit policy proposals? Or perhaps a hybrid system where people could submit policies that people could vote on and/or policymakers could review. Maybe the public has a brilliant idea that would work better than anything the policymakers come up with. This could be especially valuable from specific institutions with deep knowledge of a domain like police officers who may think up policy solutions that a policymaker would never think of because they lack the on-the-ground institutional knowledge. If chosen in part of whole, the person’s policy could be rewarded with money/fame/etc.

- There’s always a breakover point within a mandate/policy where people actually need to execute, and within there you can get artistic taste, execution failure, running over budget, etc. Whose responsibility is that? How do we fairly audit policy result if the policy was in theory brilliant but executed extremely poorly though no fault of the policymaker?

- ### 3.2 Categories
    - **Foundational Mandates**: Permanent, essential state functions (defense, justice, public safety, infrastructure).  
    - **Strategic Mandates**: Evolving societal objectives (environmental quality, education, equality, innovation). Reviewed every six years.
    - Are those the right categories? How do we decide what’s foundational vs strategic? Is there a better grouping? How do we ensure something like education/healthcare get eternal funding? Is there a foundational theory of thriving civilization we can lean on to identify these core pillars that, regardless of country or technology, are fundamental to a thriving citizenry?

- Investigate people like Larry Sharpe and his brand of extreme incentiveization and libertarianism. Is this a specific school of thought we can pull foundational ideas from? A lot of his very clever ideas are policy ideas and would simply be welcome to compete in the open policymaker competitions.

- Probably need a Technology Assumptions section. Do we assume blockchain exists? AI (and at what capabilities)? Universal computer/internet access? Digital identity? But I suppose these woulnd't be captured in the constitution, but rather in specific policies or acts that proscribe specific technologies or implementations.

- Consitutional Core: Should this be explict in the constitution? A strong "spirit of the law" that can both be used as a litmus test for new proposals AND as a guide for the judiciary? Has that ever been done before? Does it work? Is it a good idea?

- Executive Council accountability: What measurable selection, rotation, and performance metrics ensure the nonpartisan expert council remains aligned and auditable over time?

- Are we missing any fundamental parts of a constitution?

- Would adopting a subsumption-based model for the constitution be a good idea? That's sort of how legal precidence, amendments, etc work already, but maybe if we think deeply about that mechanism and research it on the web we can find/create a brilliant core mechanism.

- Should major Acts include a published “Core Compliance Statement” in the Civic Outcomes Ledger? What threshold defines “major,” and who verifies completeness?
- How do we phrase the Core in Article I to avoid redundancy with `IV. Economic Order` and `X. Transparency` while keeping it explicit and useful?
- Best placement for the Core: embedded under `I. Foundations` vs. a standalone article; any downstream effects on interpretation or numbering?

- Add a Bill of Rights — a core constitutional section that explicitly enumerates individual rights and freedoms
    - Include clear amendment mechanics — possibly modeled on a Swiss-style double-majority (citizens + sub-units) to evolve rights while preventing populist swings.
    - Rights must be explicit, rigid, and speech-protective, modeled closer to the U.S. First Amendment than the Canadian Charter.
    - Only allow narrow, objective carve-outs (incitement to imminent violence, true threats, defamation).
    - Prevent subjective limits such as offense or emotional harm from being used to restrict speech.
    - Courts interpret laws through the Core principles, ensuring power checks always trump convenience.
    - Consider graded penalties that restrict specific rights (e.g., travel, vote, bear arms) rather than automatic imprisonment, making justice proportional and rights-aware.

- Misfortune Insurance: Related to rights (a right TO insurance by the state).
  - Basic medical falls under this, I'd think, especially when it's catastrophic: accidents, illnesses, etc.
  - Slippery slope, though. What about the rest of Maslow's hierarchy? Why or why not? And what standard of misfortune do we use? Seems arbitrary. What if someone's face is burned. Do we owe them reconstructive surgery? How do we balance the cost/benefit of the care? Does society pay a million dollars to save someone from cancer? Ten million? 100? A billion? Do we need a callous price set on lives or the quality thereof? That sounds horrible.

- Basic Needs: How do we balance what the state provides vs what people can provide for themselves?

- Balancing core pessimism on human nature: One of the core tenets is to assume human nature is selfish, error-prone, and corrupt. A cyncial read would say there's now way we can provide unemployment insurance because people will just game the system. How do we balance this? What about people who say they can't work because of subjective disability (mental anguish, pain that can't be measured, etc)? It's a perfect opening for bad actors to game the system, but 100% denying subjective reasons feels like a violation of human rights.

- Corpoate "rights"? Does this make any sense? I know very little about it but I suspect it's simply another example of crony capitalism and should have never existed.

- The right to arms and self-defence are tricky. I get why the US has it; their constituon was born of paranoia around power. And we want to enshrine that same assumption that everyone is a bad actor and protect against abuse at their hands. Arms is the ultimate safety net against abuse by the state. The last resort is always violence, and if they strip the ability for anyone to protect themselves, a bad state could easily become a totalitarian one. And if that's the reasoning, there is no reasonable limit on arms. If they're meant to fight the state in the worst case scenario but we limit the population to butter knives, that's the same as outlawing self-defence. But we ARE assuming people are going to be bad actors, which means we're potentially leting the worst people with the worst intentions have the most lethal weapons that can main/kill one or many people.
- And for self-defence, it seems like a liberty... If someone is attempting to do something bad to you, it's irrational to wait for the state to proect you. That could mean theft or death. I also don't mind the premise that if someone is trying to do something terrible to you, you're allowed to do something terrible back. It not only feels fair, but it discourages people from trying to do something terrible to you in the first place. But now you get into all sorts of issues with proprtionality and timeliness. If someone steals from me and I know where they are can I go get it? Can I fight them for it legally? Can I break into their car to get it? Their house? Can I stab them? Can I kill their dog while trying to retrieve my property? Man. This isn't easy.

- So it's important to protect the rights of citizens from the state. We also need to work on protecting the rights of citizens from other citizens. I like the core tenet of "your rights end where another's begin" because it takes care of most of it. Is that sufficient?

- "Petition" -- this gets interesting when there are no politicians... We have a kickstarter system of policies. Who addresses complaints? That's feedback into the metrics of dissatisfaction with some aspect, isn't it? We already have a channel for that. However, that also opens it to the tyranny of the majority. Complaints about no wheelchair access are ignored if the satisfaction metric among people who don't need them is high enough.

- How do we deal with visitor's rights? We need to address that. Clearly they don't have the same full set of rights as citizens. What are their rights? How do we protect them? How do we balance their rights with the rights of citizens? The US' current situation also gives rise to another question: what rights does someone who is illegally in the country have? With visitors we've expliciily given them the right to be here and therefore afford them certain rights and protections. But if you're here illegally, we've given you no such permission. But we must still grant them CERTAIN rights. If someone's here illegally a citizen can't just kill them without consequence. Perhaps they only get the core set of inalienable rights? Or a subset thereof? But it also seems inhuman to not grant them things like due process. But we also see in the US that if you get into a situation where a million illegals are in your country, "due process" may cost you billions of dollars and decades. That is grossly unfair both to legal immigrants and to citizens and their tax money.

- We need strong mental support as part of the justice system. I swing toward "universal" because I'm Canadian and that feels correct and moral, but it's not techically necessary. But in the justice system it needs to make a strong evaluation as to whether the person needs mental support. I might argue they're still criminally resonsible for their actions. I really dislike the "not guilty by reason of insanity" defense as it's so easily abused and our base system assumes people will abuse the system and it should be designed with that expectation. But putting someone who's can't make rational choices is a danger to themselves and other prisoners. They deserve punishment but also require treatment, and, if that's impossible, remain confined to a mental health facility.

- Consitutional Popularity/Wisdom balance: How do we balance these? People vote in their short-term interests and without a politician and the helm, how do we ensure the population isn't voting to lower their taxes to zero or the majority voting to repress minorities? Is it just the constitution, and leave it to policy creators to try to sell their vision of the future to people even if it costs in the short term? And the constituion could have spending limits and minimal budget requirements for each article so that the population can't vote to spend more than the constitution allows or massively underfund something that's essential?

- Innovation incentives: I think basically a exipring patent system. Combined with anti-monopoly legislation might cover it. Validate against this and see if there's antyhing in here that gives better insights for a better system: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4hZAMp25s4&t=602s -- Is there a better incentive-based system if we think from first principles? And ensure it would survive a post-scarcity world. 


- Composablility vs Coherence+Flexibility: I like how I'm approaching this so far. I like the idea of a minimal composable framework. For instance the justice system derogates only ONE right as punishment: freedom of movement. But there's nothing stopping a society from passing laws to derogate other rights. Most societies also derogate the right to vote. That's completely compatible. The issue is it's not really a fundamental framework because many justice systems dole out punishments that do NOT derogate movement, so that can't really be the baseline punishment. There are many other rights you can derogate depending on the nature and severity of the crime, and they're essentially up to the moral judgement of the society, for both which rights are non-derogable (if any) and their relative moral judgement on how harsh they believe each type and severity of degogation is. So we need to rethink how composable we want our various frameworks to be. I like the concept of composability, though. Although it's hard to make a really elegant, well-integrated framework if you priorize composability over coherence. It's not like this system, if implemented, is going to be used by 1000 other societies. We should assume it will be used by one, so maybe we should be more opinionaed with it. Althogh there's still a lot of variation within a single society. Evne if this replaced, say, Canada's constitution, exactly what moral decisions the people would want to make SHOULD be left up to the people, so the design needs to be flexible within those parameters.
