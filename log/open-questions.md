# Open Questions — Civic Mandate Republic

1. **Judicial balance** — Should constitutional rights evolve via citizen referendum or remain static?  
2. **Military command** — How should emergency defense authority be structured under a limited executive?  
3. **Metric complexity** — How to ensure comprehensibility for the lay public?  
4. **Bureaucratic incentives** — How to avoid risk-averse stagnation among policymakers?  
5. **Local experimentation** — Should municipalities have independent Mandate systems?  
6. **Legacy institutions** — How to transition from political to mandate-based governance?  
7. **Cultural factors** — Would this model thrive universally, or only in high-trust societies?  
8. **Human psychology** — How to maintain meaning and identity when leadership is depersonalized?  
9. **Inter-Mandate conflicts** — What arbitration mechanisms are needed?  
10. **Technological transparency** — Could verifiable computation and cryptographic audits replace trust entirely?

- The mandate system removes an entire class of dark inventive: political power. Is there ANY left? Executive branch? Departments like the police or justice system? The chancellor? The policymakers? If so, how do we check and balance it or remove the incentive altogether?
  - Executive Council membership lacks measurable criteria (no audit metric for “nonpartisan experts” or selection/rotation cadence).
  - Define quantitative standards for Executive Council appointment, evaluation, and removal; ensure Civic Outcomes Ledger specifies governing body responsible for metric upkeep.

- AI: I do want to write this constitution assuming that AI doesn't exist but keep exploring how we could allow AI to exist within the framework or the possible benefits for instance you can massively ramp up the amount of triple verification and auditing and stuff like that automatic data collection with AI especially for things that would typically slow down government way too much like having auditing essentially that that would slow a lot of things to crawl so nothing would ever get done too much would be absorbed into bureaucracy but with AI it could be basically automatic

- Corporate checks and balances: Check my constitution to verify that there are proper checks on corporation so I'm not sure if that's explicit enough

- Pure Mandates: CAN pure mandates work with all the categories of legislation? How does it with with regular govt defines and health care and education and stuff ?

- Finish constitution (civic and mandates) and triple check for misaligned incentives. Core tenets: take into account human nature, directly vote for mandates, incentivize positively everywhere, harness natural incentives for positivity everywhere possible (eg free markets), radical transparency, checks and balances on power. Has this been tried? When/where/result? Is there anything (tech?) that kept it from being implemented in the past?

- Do policy crafters need to be a licensed profession? Why? Weigh the cost/benefits of the system vs simply an open application. If the mandates and data are completely open, does this even need to be a Bureau, or could it just be open to the general public to submit policy proposals? Or perhaps a hybrid system where people could submit policies that people could vote on and/or policymakers could review. Maybe the public has a brilliant idea that would work better than anything the policymakers come up with. This could be especially valuable from specific institutions with deep knowledge of a domain like police officers who may think up policy solutions that a policymaker would never think of because they lack the on-the-ground institutional knowledge. If chosen in part of whole, the person’s policy could be rewarded with money/fame/etc.

- There’s always a breakover point within a mandate/policy where people actually need to execute, and within there you can get artistic taste, execution failure, running over budget, etc. Whose responsibility is that? How do we fairly audit policy result if the policy was in theory brilliant but executed extremely poorly though no fault of the policymaker?

- ### 3.2 Categories
    - **Foundational Mandates**: Permanent, essential state functions (defense, justice, public safety, infrastructure).  
    - **Strategic Mandates**: Evolving societal objectives (environmental quality, education, equality, innovation). Reviewed every six years.
    - Are those the right categories? How do we decide what’s foundational vs strategic? Is there a better grouping? How do we ensure something like education/healthcare get eternal funding? Is there a foundational theory of thriving civilization we can lean on to identify these core pillars that, regardless of country or technology, are fundamental to a thriving citizenry?

- Investigate people like Larry Sharpe and his brand of extreme incentiveization and libertarianism. Is this a specific school of thought we can pull foundational ideas from? A lot of his very clever ideas are policy ideas and would simply be welcome to compete in the open policymaker competitions.

- Probably need a Technology Assumptions section. Do we assume blockchain exists? AI (and at what capabilities)? Universal computer/internet access? Digital identity? But I suppose these woulnd't be captured in the constitution, but rather in specific policies or acts that proscribe specific technologies or implementations.

- Consitutional Core: Should this be explict in the constitution? A strong "spirit of the law" that can both be used as a litmus test for new proposals AND as a guide for the judiciary? Has that ever been done before? Does it work? Is it a good idea?

- Executive Council accountability: What measurable selection, rotation, and performance metrics ensure the nonpartisan expert council remains aligned and auditable over time?

- What about something like a Bill of Rights? That's typically in a constitution, right?

- Are we missing any fundamental parts of a constitution?

- Should major Acts include a published “Core Compliance Statement” in the Civic Outcomes Ledger? What threshold defines “major,” and who verifies completeness?
- How do we phrase the Core in Article I to avoid redundancy with `IV. Economic Order` and `X. Transparency` while keeping it explicit and useful?
- Best placement for the Core: embedded under `I. Foundations` vs. a standalone article; any downstream effects on interpretation or numbering?
