# Civic Mandate Republic — Dense Summary Snapshot 0001
*(Covers inception → 2025-11)*

## Core Concept
A minimal governance model that assumes selfish human nature and channels it into positive competition and transparency.  
Democracy expresses *visions* (Public Mandates), not people; meritocratic administrators execute those visions.

## Framework
- **Public Mandates**: citizens vote on desired societal outcomes (foundational & strategic).  
- **Civic Mandate Economy**: integrates mandates, metrics, civic funding, and policycraft competitions.  
- **Policycraft**: a professional discipline; competing teams propose and refine policy solutions measured by cost, efficiency, and verified impact.  
- **Civic Intelligence Office (CIO)**: drafts and models mandates.  
- **Metrics Bureau**: audits outcomes; maintains the **Civic Outcomes Ledger** (machine-readable, permanent, transparent).  
- **Chancellor**: single-term, largely symbolic head for diplomacy and emergency response under 30/60/90 review.  
- **Judiciary**: restricted to rights and legality; citizen override for non-rights rulings.  
- **Transparency**: every action published; redactions reviewed every five years.

## Budget Model
Fixed pools: Foundational (RCV allocation), Strategic (six-year), Civic Funding (innovation), Emergency, Admin cap ≤2%.  
Balanced budget, externality tax revenue rebated to citizens.

## Philosophical Basis
- Governance built on distrust, not faith.  
- Harness vice through design (capitalism’s logic applied to governance).  
- Bureaucracy as open-source meritocracy.  
- Radical transparency over ideological alignment.

## Key Risks
Metric gaming → cross-audits + replication;  
Technocratic drift → citizen oversight panels;  
Complexity → open publication + simple acts;  
Executive bias → retro audits.

## Outcome
A model where *politics becomes engineering* — measurable, reversible, transparent.
