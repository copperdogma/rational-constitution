# ADR Draft: Eliminate/Minimize Opercular Spaces
Status: Draft  
Date: 2025-12-07

## Context

Opercular spaces are hidden or semi-shielded pockets of institutional activity where oversight, transparency, or accountability do not reach. The concept is borrowed from systems/cybernetics, referring to internal cavities where external forces don't act. In political terms, opercular spaces are regions of the system where **incentive gradients stop working**, enabling corruption, capture, and unchecked power.

### Why They Matter

- Corruption thrives wherever visibility is low and enforcement is weak.
- Opercular spaces are **structural**, not moral—they naturally form in complex systems.
- Eliminating or exposing them is essential to keeping incentive gradients aligned with public good.

### How They Form

Opercular spaces emerge through various mechanisms:

1. **Information asymmetry** — Technical or procedural complexity that obscures activity
2. **Technical complexity** — Systems too complex for non-experts to audit
3. **Legal carve-outs / exemptions** — Special rules that create protected zones
4. **Bureaucratic insulation** — Layers of procedure that shield decision-makers
5. **Budget opacity** — Financial flows that are difficult to trace or verify
6. **Political shielding** — Protection from oversight through political connections
7. **Legacy procedures** — Unquestioned processes that have become accountability-free zones

### Constitutional Implications

The constitution must address opercular spaces through:

- **Mapping and identification** — Systematically identify all possible opercular space types
- **Elimination where feasible** — Remove opercular spaces entirely by flattening the landscape
- **Parallel accountability channels** — Where removal is impossible, create alternative oversight mechanisms with penetration authority
- **Default-open processes** — Require real-time transparency streams as the default
- **System integrity mechanism** — Build ongoing detection and closure mechanisms for emerging opercular spaces

## Decision

**Status: Under Evaluation**

Mandate constitutional and structural requirements to eliminate or minimize opercular spaces: identify and map all spaces, eliminate where feasible, create parallel accountability channels where removal is impossible, require default-open processes with real-time transparency streams, and build a system integrity mechanism to detect and close emerging spaces over time.

## Rationale

- Opercular spaces are structural, not moral—they naturally form where oversight is weak.
- Corruption pools where incentive gradients fail; eliminating blind spots aligns incentives with public good.
- Complements existing transparency mechanisms (ADR-0006, Article X) with systematic prevention.
- Parallel accountability channels create overlapping oversight, preventing concentration of unaccountable power.
- System integrity mechanism ensures ongoing detection and closure of emerging spaces.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Reject concept entirely** — Rely on existing transparency mechanisms (rejected: fails to address systematic blind spots).
2. **Adopt reactively** — Address only when corruption discovered (rejected: too late, doesn't prevent formation).
3. **Limited scope** — Focus on high-risk areas only (may miss emerging spaces elsewhere).

## Consequences

- Requires constitutional mandate for opercular space identification and elimination.
- Enhances Article X (Transparency) with real-time transparency stream requirements.
- Grants oversight bodies (Article III) penetration authority into opercular spaces.
- Integrates with Civic Outcomes Ledger (ADR-0006) to track mapping and closure activities.
- Policycraft (ADR-0003) must evaluate policies for opercular space creation.
- Requires systematic audit, classification system, and ongoing detection mechanism.

## Changed Sections

*To be determined based on decision*

Potential locations: Article I (Foundations), Article III (Money Firewall and Integrity), Article X (Transparency and Public Data Integrity), or new dedicated section.

## Open Questions

1. Precise criteria for identifying opercular spaces (size, duration, impact thresholds)?
2. Authority to classify and eliminate (oversight bodies, legislature, independent commission)?
3. Balance transparency with legitimate confidentiality needs (security, negotiations)?
4. Process for determining elimination vs. parallel accountability?
5. How to prevent the detection system itself from becoming an opercular space?

## One-Line Summary

> **Opercular spaces are blind spots where incentives fail; the constitution must eliminate or expose them so the system's gradients remain aligned and corruption cannot pool.**
