# ADR Draft: Homeostatic Governance Framework
Status: Draft  
Date: 2025-12-07

## Context
The homeostatic governance framework proposes a systematic approach to policy design based on negative-feedback regulation principles. Rather than static laws, policies would maintain stable societal conditions through adaptive responses to deviations from desired states. This framework emerged from external analysis (ChatGPT conversation) and presents a comprehensive alternative to traditional policy-making approaches.

The framework consists of 10 core principles:
1. Mandate of Social Homeostasis
2. Operating Context Requirement
3. Stress Indicators & Triggered Modes
4. Hierarchical Feedback Structure
5. Negative Feedback Requirement
6. Anti-Cascade Clause
7. Damping, Rate Limits, and Safe Activation
8. Policy Rollback & Evolution Mechanism
9. Citizen Outcome Prioritization ("Slider Model")
10. Transparency & Comprehensibility Requirement

## Decision
**Status: Under Evaluation**

This ADR documents the homeostatic governance framework for consideration. The framework proposes constitutional and policy-level changes to implement adaptive, feedback-based governance systems.

## Rationale

### Alignment with Constitutional Core

**1. Assume human nature** ✓
- Framework assumes systems will deviate and require correction
- Does not rely on perfect actors or static conditions
- Aligns with assumption of imperfection

**2. Harness, don't hope** ✓
- Uses negative feedback to channel deviations back toward stability
- Creates structural incentives for self-correction
- Avoids reliance on moral character

**3. Power diffused, checked** ⚠️
- Hierarchical structure (local → sector → national) provides checks
- However, the "National Stabilizer" layer could concentrate power if not carefully designed
- Requires explicit limits on stabilizer override authority

**4. Radical transparency** ✓
- Explicit requirement for citizen-comprehensible indicators
- Public documentation of thresholds and triggers
- Transparency requirement is a core principle

**5. Democracy on outcomes** ✓
- "Slider Model" directly implements citizen voting on outcome priorities
- Policymakers compete to design systems meeting citizen-set values
- Strong alignment with existing mandate-vs-politician approach

**6. Market where possible** ⚠️
- Framework doesn't explicitly mandate market mechanisms
- Could be compatible with externality pricing, but not required
- May need explicit integration with existing market-based approaches

**7. Measurement over assertion** ✓
- Requires clear, measurable stress indicators
- Evaluation periods and rollback conditions enforce accountability
- Strong emphasis on metrics and evidence

### Key Strengths
- Provides systematic approach to adaptive governance
- Addresses policy oscillation and cascade failure risks
- Integrates citizen preference-setting with technical execution
- Includes built-in evolution and rollback mechanisms
- Emphasizes comprehensibility for citizen oversight

### Key Concerns
- Complexity: Three-level hierarchy may be difficult to implement and audit
- Stabilizer power: National stabilizer override authority needs explicit limits
- Integration: Must align with existing Chancellor system, Policycraft, and Acts
- Threshold setting: Who defines stress indicators and triggers? (May align with Policycraft)
- Negative feedback only: Prohibition on positive feedback may limit some policy tools

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Reject framework entirely** — Maintain current static policy approach
   - Pros: Simpler, more familiar
   - Cons: Lacks adaptive capacity, may amplify rather than correct deviations

2. **Adopt selectively** — Integrate specific principles (e.g., stress indicators, rollback mechanisms) without full hierarchical structure
   - Pros: Lower complexity, incremental adoption
   - Cons: May lose systemic coherence

3. **Adopt with modifications** — Implement framework but:
   - Add explicit limits on National Stabilizer authority
   - Require integration with existing Policycraft and externality pricing mechanisms
   - Clarify relationship to Chancellor system and Civic Outcomes Ledger
   - Pros: Preserves strengths while addressing concerns
   - Cons: Requires careful design to maintain coherence

4. **Full adoption** — Implement all 10 principles as constitutional/act-level requirements
   - Pros: Complete systematic approach
   - Cons: Major structural change, high implementation complexity

## Consequences

### If Adopted
- Constitutional/Act changes required to establish:
  - Mandate of Social Homeostasis
  - Three-level hierarchical feedback structure
  - Stress indicator and trigger requirements
  - Policy rollback mechanisms
  - Integration with existing systems (Chancellor, Policycraft, Ledger)
- Policycraft would need to incorporate stress indicators and thresholds
- Acts (e.g., Externality Pricing Act) would need homeostatic design elements
- Transparency Ledger would track stress indicators and trigger activations
- Requires careful design to prevent stabilizer layer from becoming too powerful

### If Rejected
- Current adaptive mechanisms (Policycraft, rollback via ADRs) remain
- May miss opportunity for systematic approach to policy stability
- Risk of policy oscillations or cascade failures not explicitly addressed

### If Selectively Adopted
- Could add stress indicators and rollback mechanisms to existing Acts
- Could implement "Slider Model" for citizen outcome prioritization
- Would need to ensure partial adoption doesn't create incoherent system

## Open Questions
1. How does the National Stabilizer relate to the Chancellor system?
2. Who defines stress indicators and thresholds? (Policycraft process?)
3. How do homeostatic triggers interact with existing policy evaluation cycles?
4. Can positive feedback loops be safely bounded, or should they be prohibited entirely?
5. How does the "Slider Model" integrate with existing mandate voting mechanisms?
6. What prevents the stabilizer layer from becoming a de facto executive override?
7. How do homeostatic mechanisms interact with externality pricing and market-based approaches?

## Notes
- Framework philosophy: "Government becomes a stability engine: citizens set direction, policymakers design the architecture, and homeostatic systems maintain balance automatically."
- This aligns with existing "democracy on outcomes" principle but adds systematic feedback architecture
- Requires careful integration to avoid conflicts with existing systems while preserving their strengths
