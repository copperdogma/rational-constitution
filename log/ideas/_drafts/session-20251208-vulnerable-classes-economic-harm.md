# ADR-0013: Vulnerable Classes Clause and Economic Harm Constraint
Status: Draft  
Date: 2025-12-08

## Context

The Constitution currently lacks explicit frameworks for:
1. Defining and protecting vulnerable populations in a way that prevents gaming and maintains objective criteria
2. Constraining the State from imposing disproportionate economic harm on individuals or groups

These gaps create risks of:
- Subjective or self-ascribed protected classes expanding without constitutional process
- Sudden, catastrophic economic harm being imposed through policy without compensation or transition mechanisms
- Legal instability from ambiguous membership criteria in protected groups
- Tyranny of the majority through policies that impose concentrated losses

## Decision

Add two new constitutional provisions:

### SECTION I — Vulnerable Classes Clause

(Constitutional Text)

1. Definition of Vulnerable Classes

A Vulnerable Class is a category of persons who share objective, externally verifiable characteristics that substantially impair their ability to secure their fundamental interests without additional legal protection.

2. Objective Criteria

To qualify as a Vulnerable Class, membership must be based on characteristics that:

	•	are observable or medically verifiable,

	•	are consistent and non-arbitrary,

	•	are not dependent solely on self-ascription, and

	•	can be publicly defined without circular reasoning.

3. Enumerated Status Only

No category shall receive the legal protections reserved for Vulnerable Classes unless it is explicitly designated as such in this Constitution through constitutional amendment.

4. Risk Assessment Not Sufficient

Empirical evidence of higher risk or harm to a group does not, on its own, grant that group protected status. Such evidence may inform public deliberation but confers no legal classification unless adopted through constitutional process.

⸻

Rationale (for inclusion in commentary/explanatory materials)

This framework ensures that enhanced legal protections are granted only to groups whose vulnerabilities arise from stable, objective characteristics, not from self-declared identity categories.

It prevents:

	•	gaming the system through self-identification,

	•	ever-expanding protected classes created by political pressure,

	•	ambiguity in who belongs to a protected group,

	•	and legal instability caused by subjective membership criteria.

By requiring constitutional amendment to add new Vulnerable Classes, the system guarantees that society grants such protections deliberately, through informed consent, rather than through bureaucratic or judicial reinterpretation.

This preserves both legitimacy and predictability, while still allowing society to expand protections when broad consensus exists.

⸻

### SECTION II — Economic Harm Constraint

(Constitutional Text)

1. Protection from Disproportionate Economic Harm

The State shall not, through its laws or actions, impose abrupt, severe, or disproportionately concentrated economic harm on identifiable individuals or groups, except where explicitly authorized by this Constitution and accompanied by just compensation or transition mechanisms.

2. Temporal Gradualism

Any policy expected to impose significant economic harm must do so at a reasonable and gradual rate, allowing affected persons the opportunity to adapt. Catastrophic or sudden losses shall be considered unconstitutional unless necessary for the survival of the State and accompanied by guaranteed compensation.

3. Compensation Requirement

Where concentrated economic harm is foreseeable, the State must provide compensation, transition support, or equivalent remedies proportionate to the loss.

4. Constitutional Supremacy of Protections

These protections may not be suspended, overridden, or nullified by ordinary legislation or referendum.

A constitutional amendment proposing to authorize such harm must itself satisfy the principles of proportionality, gradualism, and non-punitive intent.

5. Foreseeability Standard

Economic harm is considered State-caused when a reasonable policymaker, using standard analysis, could have foreseen the harm as a consequence of the policy, whether the immediate mechanism is market-based or regulatory.

## Rationale

### Vulnerable Classes Clause

- **Prevents gaming**: Objective, verifiable criteria prevent individuals from self-identifying into protected classes for strategic advantage
- **Maintains stability**: Constitutional enumeration ensures protected classes are added only through broad consensus, not bureaucratic or judicial expansion
- **Preserves legitimacy**: Clear, non-circular definitions maintain public trust in the protection system
- **Allows evolution**: Constitutional amendment process permits society to expand protections when genuine consensus exists

### Economic Harm Constraint

- **Prevents tyranny of majority**: Protects minorities from bearing disproportionate costs of majority-preferred policies
- **Ensures fairness**: Compensation and transition mechanisms prevent catastrophic losses to individuals or groups
- **Promotes stability**: Gradual implementation allows adaptation and reduces social disruption
- **Constitutional supremacy**: Prevents ordinary legislation from circumventing these protections
- **Foreseeability standard**: Ensures accountability for predictable consequences, whether direct or market-mediated

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Judicial determination of vulnerable classes** — Rejected because it allows expansion without democratic process and creates legal instability
2. **Statutory protected classes** — Rejected because ordinary legislation can be changed too easily, lacks permanence
3. **No economic harm constraint** — Rejected because it permits tyranny of majority and catastrophic losses
4. **Ordinary legislation for economic harm protection** — Rejected because it can be overridden by simple majority, lacks constitutional weight
5. **Subjective or self-ascribed protected classes** — Rejected because it enables gaming and creates ambiguity

## Consequences

### Vulnerable Classes Clause

- **Positive**:
  - Clear, objective criteria for protected status
  - Prevents expansion through bureaucratic or judicial interpretation
  - Maintains legal stability and predictability
  - Requires broad consensus for new protected classes

- **Challenges**:
  - May initially exclude some groups that lack objective, verifiable characteristics
  - Requires constitutional amendment process to add new classes (higher threshold)
  - May be seen as restrictive by advocates for identity-based protections

### Economic Harm Constraint

- **Positive**:
  - Protects minorities from disproportionate policy costs
  - Ensures compensation and transition support
  - Promotes gradual, stable policy implementation
  - Constitutional supremacy prevents circumvention

- **Challenges**:
  - May constrain necessary but disruptive policy changes
  - Requires careful definition of "foreseeable" and "disproportionate"
  - Compensation mechanisms may be costly
  - May slow rapid response to crises (though survival exception addresses this)

## Core Alignment

### Vulnerable Classes Clause
- ✅ **Assume human nature** — Prevents gaming through self-identification
- ✅ **Harness, don't hope** — Uses objective criteria to channel behavior
- ✅ **Power diffused, checked** — Constitutional enumeration prevents bureaucratic expansion
- ✅ **Radical transparency** — Objective criteria are publicly verifiable
- ✅ **Democracy on outcomes** — Constitutional amendment requires broad consensus
- ✅ **Market where possible** — N/A (rights framework)
- ✅ **Measurement over assertion** — Objective, verifiable characteristics required

### Economic Harm Constraint
- ✅ **Assume human nature** — Prevents majority from imposing costs on minorities
- ✅ **Harness, don't hope** — Uses compensation and gradualism to manage transitions
- ✅ **Power diffused, checked** — Constitutional supremacy prevents legislative override
- ✅ **Radical transparency** — Foreseeability standard requires public analysis
- ✅ **Democracy on outcomes** — Allows policy but requires compensation/transition
- ✅ **Market where possible** — Market-based mechanisms can be used for compensation
- ✅ **Measurement over assertion** — Foreseeability and proportionality require measurable analysis

## Changed Sections

If accepted, these provisions would be added as new sections to the Constitution:
- New section in Article VII (Rights and Liberties) or as a new Article for Vulnerable Classes Clause
- New section in Article IV (Economic Order) or as a new Article for Economic Harm Constraint

## Links

- Related to ADR-0007 (Public Mandates) — addresses tyranny of majority concerns
- Related to Article IV (Economic Order) — economic harm constraint complements economic framework
- Related to Article VII (Rights and Liberties) — vulnerable classes clause extends rights framework
- Related to Foundational Design Principles — both provisions align with incentive-compatible design and distributed accountability
