# ADR Draft: First-Principles Property and Privacy Framework

**Status:** Draft  
**Date:** 2025-12-08  
**Topic:** Constitutional framework for property rights and privacy derived from first principles

## Context

*** Complete First-Principles Property/Privacy Framework ***


Below is a complete, polished package containing:
	1.	The Constitutional Clauses (clean, neutral legal style)
	2.	Framers’ Commentary (separate—not part of the constitution text)
	3.	Logical Dependency Graph
	4.	Concrete Examples (fruit, tools, houses, ideas, data, etc.)

Everything is precise, minimal, and fully derived from your axioms.

⸻

1. CONSTITUTIONAL CLAUSES (CLEAN, FORMAL TEXT)

These appear in the constitution itself.
No technical jargon, no ideology, and no repetition of axioms already stated elsewhere.

⸻

I. Action-Result Property Clause

1.1
Agents have exclusive control over physical objects they create or produce through their actions.

1.2
Such control may not be overridden except through voluntary transfer or through enforcement actions that satisfy the requirements of justification and minimal interference established in this Constitution.

⸻

II. Information and Expression Clause

2.1
Agents control their own acts of expression, communication, and disclosure.

2.2
No agent may be compelled to express, disclose, or transmit information except as permitted under the justified enforcement provisions of this Constitution.

2.3
Information voluntarily expressed or communicated to others does not grant the expressing agent control over the internal memory, reasoning, or mental use of that information by recipients.

⸻

III. Natural Resource Allocation Clause

3.1
Unproduced natural resources, including land, minerals, water, and naturally occurring materials, shall be governed by general, publicly knowable rules established by the community.

3.2
Such rules must conform to the principles of equality, reciprocity, predictability, and human comprehensibility set forth in this Constitution.

3.3
No claim of exclusive control over unproduced natural resources may be made except as provided for under these general rules.

⸻

IV. State Action and Individual Targeting Clause (Privacy)

4.1
The state may not take any action directed at an identifiable agent without reasonable grounds to believe that the agent has violated, or is in the process of violating, the law.

4.2
State actions subject to this requirement include, but are not limited to: surveillance, monitoring, tracking, searching, recording, interception, compelled disclosure, detention, and investigative targeting.

4.3
State actions undertaken for general, non-targeted safety or administrative purposes are permitted, provided they apply equally and do not identify or single out specific agents without justification.

⸻

Those four clauses complete the constitutional property/privacy package.

⸻

2. FRAMERS’ COMMENTARY (NOT PART OF THE CONSTITUTION)

This is the “design reasoning” future interpreters can refer to.
It explains why each clause exists and how it follows from the axioms.

⸻

Commentary on the Action-Result Property Clause

Human agency operates in a physical world where created objects are rivalrous—if one person uses a tool or food they produced, others cannot simultaneously use the same object.
If such objects could be arbitrarily taken, an agent’s planning, effort, and survival would be undermined.
Thus, control over created objects is necessary for agency to be meaningful.

This clause does not cover unproduced natural resources. It applies only to items whose existence or utility depends on an agent’s actions (e.g., tools, gathered food, constructed shelters, crafted goods).

⸻

Commentary on the Information and Expression Clause

Information is non-rivalrous. Once voluntarily communicated, others cannot be constitutionally forbidden from mentally retaining or using their own thoughts. Attempting to control what others remember or think violates bodily and mental integrity.

However, agents retain full control over their own acts of expression and cannot be compelled to communicate without justified enforcement.

This avoids constitutionalizing intellectual property while allowing societies to adopt downstream IP systems if desired.

⸻

Commentary on the Natural Resource Allocation Clause

Land and other natural resources precede all action. Since unilateral claims impose obligations on others, they cannot arise as natural rights under moral equality and reciprocity.

Therefore, unproduced resources must be allocated through publicly knowable, general rules chosen by the community.
The constitution does not specify those rules; it merely ensures they are fair, legible, and compliant with the axioms.

This avoids retroactive adjudication of ancient land claims and allows any model—public, private, leasehold, homestead, commons—to be adopted democratically.

⸻

Commentary on the State Action and Individual Targeting Clause

Privacy is not a discrete right but the consequence of limiting unjustified state action.

If the state may target individuals without reason, it can:
	•	punish disfavored persons arbitrarily,
	•	chill lawful activity,
	•	intimidate political opponents,
	•	and destroy predictability.

Therefore, any directed action against a specific person must be grounded in reasonable suspicion of a legal violation.
General safety measures (e.g., non-specific monitoring of public spaces) are allowed, but targeted actions are not.

This principle replaces the need for detailed search/seizure language and automatically bans mass surveillance on individuals without cause.

⸻

3. LOGICAL DEPENDENCY GRAPH

Axioms supporting each clause:

AGENCY
  ↳ Agents act, create, and plan over time
  ↳ Created objects must remain under agent control (Clause 1)

NON-INTERFERENCE
  ↳ Others may not negate the effects of lawful actions
  ↳ Arbitrary seizure of created objects = interference (Clause 1)
  ↳ Forced speech = interference (Clause 2)
  ↳ Unjustified state targeting = interference (Clause 4)

PREDICTABILITY
  ↳ Agents require stable expectations
  ↳ Property rules must be general and knowable
  ↳ State action cannot be arbitrary (Clauses 3 and 4)

MORAL EQUALITY & RECIPROCITY
  ↳ Unilateral land claims impose duties → not allowed (Clause 3)
  ↳ State rules must apply equally → targeted action requires cause (Clause 4)

HUMAN COGNITIVE BOUNDS
  ↳ Natural resource rules must be understandable (Clause 3.2)
  ↳ Enforcement justification must be legible (Clause 4.1)


⸻

4. EXAMPLES (APPLYING THE CLAUSES)

These help future interpreters see how the system works.

⸻

A) Created Objects

Fruit Gathering

You gather fruit → you created a usable object through action → it is yours until voluntarily transferred or forfeited under justified enforcement.

Spear Assembly

You carve the shaft; Grog forges the head.
Each of you owns your component.
Who owns the combined spear?
→ Determined by contract or default property law.
→ Constitution deliberately does not settle this.

House Building

You gather materials and construct a small hut.
You own the hut, not the land, unless land rules say otherwise.

⸻

B) Information & Expression

Speech

You cannot be compelled to reveal information without lawful justification.

Memory

If you speak voluntarily and someone hears it, they are free to remember and mentally use that information.

IP

If society wants patent or copyright systems, they must be statutory—
not natural rights.

⸻

C) Natural Resources

Land

A society may choose:
	•	all land publicly owned,
	•	private freehold,
	•	leasehold only,
	•	mixed public-private,
	•	homestead rules,
	•	indigenous stewardship.

All are allowed, provided:
	•	the rules are general,
	•	legible,
	•	equal,
	•	reciprocal.

Water rights, minerals, forests

Same principle.

⸻

D) Privacy / State Action

Targeted Surveillance

Police may not follow, track, search, or monitor a specific individual absent reasonable suspicion.

General CCTV

Non-targeted general monitoring in public spaces is allowed (per clause 4.3), but targeted zooming in on a particular person requires cause.

Fishing Expeditions

Illegal.
The state cannot “look until it finds something.”

Discriminatory Enforcement

Explicitly forbidden.
Reasonable grounds must be tied to conduct, not identity.

## Decision

Adopt four constitutional clauses establishing property rights and privacy protections derived from first principles:

1. **Action-Result Property Clause** – Agents have exclusive control over physical objects they create or produce through their actions, subject only to voluntary transfer or justified enforcement.

2. **Information and Expression Clause** – Agents control their own acts of expression and communication; cannot be compelled to disclose except under justified enforcement; information voluntarily communicated does not grant control over recipients' mental use of that information.

3. **Natural Resource Allocation Clause** – Unproduced natural resources (land, minerals, water) shall be governed by general, publicly knowable rules established by the community, conforming to equality, reciprocity, predictability, and human comprehensibility.

4. **State Action and Individual Targeting Clause (Privacy)** – The state may not take any action directed at an identifiable agent without reasonable grounds to believe the agent has violated or is violating the law. General, non-targeted safety measures are permitted if they apply equally.

These clauses replace vague references to "property" and "privacy" in Article VII with precise, axiom-derived protections.

---

## Rationale

### First-Principles Derivation

The framework derives from foundational axioms rather than tradition or ideology:

- **Agency** → Created objects must remain under agent control (Clause 1)
- **Non-Interference** → Arbitrary seizure, forced speech, and unjustified targeting are prohibited (Clauses 1, 2, 4)
- **Predictability** → Property rules and state action must be general and knowable (Clauses 3, 4)
- **Moral Equality & Reciprocity** → Unilateral land claims impose duties and are not allowed; state rules must apply equally (Clauses 3, 4)
- **Human Cognitive Bounds** → Rules must be understandable and enforcement justification must be legible (Clauses 3.2, 4.1)

### Key Design Choices

1. **Created vs. Unproduced Resources** – Distinguishes between objects created through action (which agents control) and natural resources (which require community rules). This avoids retroactive land claim disputes and allows democratic choice of allocation models.

2. **Information as Non-Rivalrous** – Recognizes that information, once communicated, cannot be controlled in recipients' minds without violating bodily/mental integrity. This avoids constitutionalizing intellectual property while allowing statutory IP systems if desired.

3. **Privacy as Limitation on State Action** – Privacy is not a discrete right but the consequence of requiring justification for targeted state action. This automatically bans mass surveillance without cause and replaces need for detailed search/seizure language.

4. **Minimal and Precise** – Clauses are clean, neutral legal text without technical jargon or ideology. Commentary is separate and not part of the constitution itself.

---

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Traditional Property Rights** – Lockean "mixing labor with land" or homesteading models. Rejected because they create unilateral claims over unproduced resources, violating moral equality and reciprocity.

2. **Intellectual Property as Natural Right** – Constitutionalizing copyright/patent as inherent property. Rejected because information is non-rivalrous and controlling mental use violates bodily integrity; IP should be statutory if adopted at all.

3. **Comprehensive Privacy Rights** – Enumerating specific privacy protections (e.g., "right to be forgotten," data portability). Rejected in favor of principle-based approach that covers all forms of targeted state action without exhaustive enumeration.

4. **Mandatory Land Allocation Model** – Specifying a particular system (e.g., all public, all private, leasehold only). Rejected to allow democratic choice while ensuring rules are general, legible, equal, and reciprocal.

5. **Status Quo** – Keeping Article VII's vague "property, privacy" references. Rejected because they provide insufficient guidance and fail to derive from first principles.

---

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Clear Guidance** – Future interpreters have precise, axiom-derived principles rather than vague references.
- **Flexibility** – Natural resource allocation can be chosen democratically (public, private, leasehold, commons, etc.) while maintaining constitutional guardrails.
- **Automatic Protections** – Privacy protections extend to all forms of targeted state action without exhaustive enumeration.
- **Avoids IP Constitutionalization** – Allows statutory IP systems without creating natural rights claims.
- **Prevents Land Disputes** – Avoids retroactive adjudication of ancient claims by requiring general, knowable rules.

### Challenges

- **Implementation Details** – Some edge cases (e.g., joint creation, combined objects) left to contract and property law rather than constitution.
- **"Reasonable Grounds" Standard** – Requires judicial interpretation to define threshold for targeted state action.
- **Natural Resource Rules** – Community must establish allocation rules; constitution provides framework but not specific model.

### Integration Points

- Expands Article VII (Rights and Liberties) which currently lists "property, privacy" without detail.
- Complements Article IV.4 ("Property Rights and Contracts") by providing constitutional foundation.
- Aligns with Article VII's existing due process and equality provisions.

## Core Alignment

1. **Assume human nature** ✓ – Framework assumes agents act in self-interest; property protections enable planning and effort; state targeting restrictions prevent arbitrary abuse.

2. **Harness, don't hope** ✓ – Property rights channel self-interest toward productive creation; natural resource rules prevent unilateral claims; transparency requirements (general, knowable rules) prevent hidden capture.

3. **Power diffused, checked** ✓ – State targeting requires justification; natural resource allocation requires general, publicly knowable rules chosen by community; no unilateral authority over unproduced resources.

4. **Radical transparency** ✓ – Natural resource rules must be publicly knowable; state targeting must be justified and legible; general safety measures must apply equally.

5. **Democracy on outcomes** ✓ – Natural resource allocation chosen democratically; rules must be general and community-established; state action must be justified by law.

6. **Market where possible** ✓ – Property rights enable markets; natural resource allocation can include market-based models (private, leasehold); externality pricing (from Article IV.6) applies to property use.

7. **Measurement over assertion** ✓ – "Reasonable grounds" for state targeting requires evidence; natural resource rules must be predictable and measurable; enforcement justification must be legible.

**Overall:** Fully aligned with all seven Core principles.

## Changed Sections

If implemented, this would expand **Article VII (Rights and Liberties)** to include the four clauses. The current text states:

> Speech, press, assembly, belief, privacy, due process, property, equality before law.

This would be replaced or supplemented with the detailed clauses, maintaining the existing list while adding constitutional precision.

The framers' commentary, logical dependency graph, and examples would be preserved in this ADR and related documentation, not in the constitution itself (per clean text policy).

## Open Questions

1. **Panopticon surveillance in the AI era**: This item doesn't forbid panopticon surveillance. Historically that wasn't an issue but in the age of AI where, if you've recorded everything, you can retroactively trace a single person's every move, is troubling. Not sure if we need to address it, but it does require us to think from first principles about privacy. The framework's clause 4.3 states: "State actions undertaken for general, non-targeted safety or administrative purposes are permitted, provided they apply equally and do not identify or single out specific agents without justification." Does this adequately address AI-era panopticon concerns, or do we need additional protections?
