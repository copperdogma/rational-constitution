# ADR-0014: Economic Harm Constraint
Status: Draft  
Date: 2025-12-08

## Context

The Constitution currently lacks explicit constraints preventing the State from imposing sudden, severe, or disproportionately concentrated economic harm on identifiable individuals or groups through policy actions.

This gap creates risks of:
- Tyranny of the majority where popular policies impose catastrophic losses on minorities
- Sudden policy changes that destroy livelihoods without compensation or transition support
- Arbitrary regulatory harm that targets specific groups or industries
- Loss of public trust in state action due to unpredictable economic consequences
- Market-based mechanisms being used to impose punitive losses that would be unconstitutional if done directly

While markets naturally cause gains and losses, the State controls the timing, scale, and targeting of policy changes, and must therefore be held to higher standards than natural market forces.

## Decision

Add a new constitutional provision: **Economic Harm Constraint**

(Constitutional Text)

1. Protection from Disproportionate Economic Harm

The State shall not, through its laws or actions, impose abrupt, severe, or disproportionately concentrated economic harm on identifiable individuals or groups, except where explicitly authorized by this Constitution and accompanied by just compensation or transition mechanisms.

2. Temporal Gradualism

Any policy expected to impose significant economic harm must do so at a reasonable and gradual rate, allowing affected persons the opportunity to adapt. Catastrophic or sudden losses shall be considered unconstitutional unless necessary for the survival of the State and accompanied by guaranteed compensation.

3. Compensation Requirement

Where concentrated economic harm is foreseeable, the State must provide compensation, transition support, or equivalent remedies proportionate to the loss.

4. Constitutional Supremacy of Protections

These protections may not be suspended, overridden, or nullified by ordinary legislation or referendum.

A constitutional amendment proposing to authorize such harm must itself satisfy the principles of proportionality, gradualism, and non-punitive intent.

5. Foreseeability Standard

Economic harm is considered State-caused when a reasonable policymaker, using standard analysis, could have foreseen the harm as a consequence of the policy, whether the immediate mechanism is market-based or regulatory.

⸻

Rationale (for inclusion in commentary/explanatory materials)

This clause prevents the State from inflicting targeted, sudden, or punitive economic losses on individuals or groups through policy, whether intentionally or negligently.

It recognizes that:

	•	Markets naturally cause gains and losses,

	•	but the State controls timing, scale, and targeting,

and must therefore be held to higher standards.

The principles of proportionality, gradualism, and compensation ensure that necessary public policy can still occur (housing reform, environmental regulations, economic transitions), but do so predictably and fairly, without economic shock or group-based punishment.

This clause protects against both majoritarian abuse ("let's confiscate their wealth tomorrow") and arbitrary regulatory harm, ensuring long-term stability and trust in state action.

## Rationale

- **Prevents tyranny of majority**: Protects minorities from bearing disproportionate costs of majority-preferred policies
- **Ensures fairness**: Compensation and transition mechanisms prevent catastrophic losses to individuals or groups
- **Promotes stability**: Gradual implementation allows adaptation and reduces social disruption
- **Constitutional supremacy**: Prevents ordinary legislation from circumventing these protections
- **Foreseeability standard**: Ensures accountability for predictable consequences, whether direct or market-mediated
- **State accountability**: Recognizes that State-controlled policy timing and targeting require higher standards than natural market forces
- **Prevents punitive targeting**: Blocks both intentional and negligent imposition of concentrated economic harm

## Alternatives Considered

1. **No economic harm constraint** — Rejected because it permits tyranny of majority and catastrophic losses without recourse
2. **Ordinary legislation for economic harm protection** — Rejected because it can be overridden by simple majority, lacks constitutional weight and permanence
3. **Judicial determination only** — Rejected because it creates uncertainty and inconsistent application; constitutional provision provides clear standard
4. **Ex post compensation only** — Rejected because it doesn't prevent harm, only mitigates after the fact; gradualism and transition support are more effective
5. **Market-based harm excluded** — Rejected because State can use market mechanisms to impose harm that would be unconstitutional if done directly; foreseeability standard addresses this
6. **Emergency exception without compensation** — Rejected because even survival-necessary actions should provide compensation when possible; current provision requires compensation even in survival cases

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Protects minorities**: Prevents majority from imposing catastrophic costs on identifiable groups
- **Ensures fairness**: Compensation and transition mechanisms provide safety net for policy changes
- **Promotes stability**: Gradual implementation reduces social disruption and allows adaptation
- **Builds trust**: Predictable, fair policy implementation maintains public confidence in state action
- **Constitutional protection**: Cannot be overridden by ordinary legislation, ensuring permanence
- **Prevents gaming**: Foreseeability standard prevents State from using market mechanisms to circumvent direct harm prohibitions
- **Allows necessary policy**: Still permits housing reform, environmental regulations, and economic transitions when done fairly

### Challenges

- **May constrain rapid response**: Gradualism requirement may slow necessary policy changes, though survival exception addresses true emergencies
- **Definitional questions**: Requires careful definition of "foreseeable," "disproportionate," and "significant economic harm" through case law or legislation
- **Compensation costs**: Compensation mechanisms may be expensive, requiring careful fiscal planning
- **Judicial interpretation**: Courts will need to develop standards for what constitutes "reasonable and gradual rate" and "proportionate" compensation
- **Market-mediated harm**: Distinguishing between natural market forces and State-caused harm may be complex in some cases
- **Transition support design**: Requires development of effective transition mechanisms (retraining, relocation, etc.)

## Core Alignment

- ✅ **Assume human nature** — Prevents majority from imposing costs on minorities; recognizes State actors may act in self-interest
- ✅ **Harness, don't hope** — Uses compensation and gradualism to manage transitions rather than hoping for voluntary adaptation
- ✅ **Power diffused, checked** — Constitutional supremacy prevents legislative override; requires constitutional amendment with high threshold
- ✅ **Radical transparency** — Foreseeability standard requires public analysis and documentation of expected consequences
- ✅ **Democracy on outcomes** — Allows policy implementation but requires fair process; citizens can still vote for outcomes, but implementation must be fair
- ✅ **Market where possible** — Market-based mechanisms can be used for compensation and transition support
- ✅ **Measurement over assertion** — Foreseeability and proportionality require measurable analysis of expected harm and appropriate compensation

## Changed Sections

If accepted, this provision would be added as a new section to the Constitution:
- New section in Article IV (Economic Order) — most natural fit as it relates to economic policy
- Alternatively, could be a new Article or added to Article VII (Rights and Liberties) as an economic rights protection

- Related to ADR-0008 (Fiscal Structure) — compensation mechanisms relate to fiscal policy
- Related to Article IV (Economic Order) — economic harm constraint complements and constrains economic policy framework
- Related to Article VII (Rights and Liberties) — could be framed as an economic rights protection
