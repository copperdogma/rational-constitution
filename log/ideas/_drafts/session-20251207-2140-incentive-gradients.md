# ADR Draft: Incentive Gradients — Constitutional Design Note
Status: Draft  
Date: 2025-12-07

## Context

Political behavior can be modeled as movement along incentive gradients: actors follow the lowest-resistance path toward status, power, and gain. Corruption occurs when the landscape makes private gain a downhill path. Good governance emerges when the easiest, safest, most rewarding route for ambitious actors is public-aligned performance.

This design note proposes a framework for constitutional design that treats corruption as a systemic equilibrium rather than a moral failure, and designs institutions to make corruption structurally unprofitable.

### Core Concept

**Incentive Gradients Model:**
- Actors (politicians, bureaucrats, lobbyists, corporations) move along paths of least resistance
- Natural attractor states emerge for power, wealth, and status
- Corruption occurs when private gain is "downhill" (low cost, high reward, low risk)
- Good governance requires making public-aligned performance the easiest, safest, most rewarding path

### Constitutional Design Task

1. **Identify natural attractor states** for power/wealth/status
2. **Insert counter-gradients** where corruption, capture, or abuse would otherwise be downhill
3. **Lower friction on pro-social paths** (transparency, rule-based processes, measurable outcomes)
4. **Treat corruption as systemic equilibrium** — design institutions to make it structurally unprofitable
5. **Maintain meta-mechanism** to monitor emerging gradients and patch new attractor states

### Goal

A political landscape where ambition "flows downhill" into service, and all corrupt routes are steep, risky, and high-cost.

### Related Work

This concept builds on:
- **ADR-0001 (Human Nature Assumption)** — Assumes self-interest and designs accordingly
- **ADR-0007 (Mandate vs. Politician)** — Aligns incentives toward measurable outcomes
- **Switzerland/Singapore ADR Draft** — Singapore's approach to shaping ambition gradients aligns with this framework
- **ADR-0004 (Externality Pricing)** — Uses market mechanisms to align incentives

## Decision

**Status: Under Evaluation**

Adopt the Incentive Gradients framework as a constitutional design principle. Specifically:

1. **Model political failure modes as gradient maps** — Identify natural attractor basins, gradient flows, and required counter-gradients for:
   - Regulatory capture
   - Lobbyist influence
   - Party entrenchment
   - Opaque budgeting
   - Procurement corruption
   - Security-state misuse
   - Media concentration
   - Other systemic failure modes

2. **Design counter-gradient mechanisms** for each identified failure mode:
   - Make corruption steep (high cost)
   - Make corruption risky (high detection probability)
   - Make corruption high-cost (severe consequences)
   - Make public-aligned performance downhill (low friction, high reward, safe)

3. **Implement meta-monitoring** to detect emerging attractor states and patch new gradients

4. **Integrate with existing constitutional mechanisms:**
   - Transparency (ADR-0006) — Lowers friction on pro-social paths
   - Performance metrics (ADR-0003, ADR-0007) — Makes public outcomes the rewarding path
   - Integrity enforcement (Article III) — Makes corruption risky and high-cost
   - Externality pricing (ADR-0004) — Aligns market incentives with public good

## Rationale

### Alignment with Constitutional Core

1. **Assume human nature** ✓ — Explicitly models actors as self-interested; designs for this reality rather than hoping for virtue
2. **Harness, don't hope** ✓ — Channels ambition toward public good by making it the easiest path; avoids relying on moral restraint
3. **Power diffused, checked** ✓ — Counter-gradients prevent power concentration; meta-monitoring ensures ongoing accountability
4. **Radical transparency** ✓ — Transparency lowers friction on pro-social paths; makes corruption more detectable (steeper gradient)
5. **Democracy on outcomes** ✓ — Performance metrics make public outcomes the rewarding path; aligns ambition with citizen goals
6. **Market where possible** ✓ — Externality pricing and performance competition create natural incentive gradients
7. **Measurement over assertion** ✓ — Metrics define what "downhill" means; measurable outcomes create clear gradient maps

### Theoretical Foundation

- **Systems thinking:** Treats corruption as an equilibrium state, not individual moral failure
- **Game theory:** Models political actors as rational agents optimizing along incentive landscapes
- **Control theory:** Uses feedback loops (transparency, metrics, enforcement) to shape system behavior
- **Evolutionary dynamics:** Recognizes that attractor states emerge naturally; requires active counter-gradients

### Evidence Base

- **Singapore:** Competitive salaries and performance metrics make public service the rewarding path; dual-key oversight makes corruption risky
- **Switzerland:** Coalition-forcing and direct democracy prevent stagnation attractors; structural constraints flatten power wells
- **Regulatory capture:** Well-documented failure mode where industry influence creates downhill paths toward private gain
- **Procurement corruption:** Common in systems where opaque processes create low-friction paths for kickbacks

### Practical Application

The gradient maps approach provides:
- **Systematic analysis** of failure modes (not ad-hoc fixes)
- **Predictive design** (identify attractors before they emerge)
- **Meta-governance** (monitoring and patching mechanism)
- **Integration framework** (connects existing mechanisms into coherent system)

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Moral/legal approach only** — Rely on ethics training and criminal penalties (rejected: doesn't address systemic equilibrium)
2. **Ad-hoc fixes** — Address corruption cases as they arise (rejected: reactive, doesn't prevent new attractors)
3. **Hope for virtue** — Design assuming actors will act in public interest (rejected: violates Core Principle #1)
4. **Pure transparency** — Rely solely on transparency to prevent corruption (rejected: necessary but not sufficient; must also shape gradients)
5. **Pure enforcement** — Rely solely on penalties and oversight (rejected: doesn't make public service rewarding; may create perverse incentives)

## Consequences

### Constitutional Changes Required

1. **New Design Principle** — Add incentive gradients framework to Article I (Foundations) or create new section
2. **Gradient Maps** — Document failure modes and counter-gradients (possibly in reference document or constitutional appendix)
3. **Meta-Monitoring Mechanism** — Establish institution to monitor emerging attractor states and propose gradient patches
4. **Integration with Existing Mechanisms:**
   - **Transparency (Article X)** — Explicitly frame as gradient-shaping mechanism
   - **Performance Metrics (Article II, ADR-0003, ADR-0007)** — Frame as making public outcomes the rewarding path
   - **Integrity Enforcement (Article III)** — Frame as making corruption risky and high-cost
   - **Externality Pricing (ADR-0004)** — Frame as market-based gradient alignment

### Implementation Challenges

1. **Gradient mapping complexity** — How to systematically identify all attractor states? How to model gradient flows?
2. **Counter-gradient design** — How to ensure counter-gradients are effective? How to measure gradient steepness?
3. **Meta-monitoring design** — Who monitors? How to detect emerging attractors? What triggers gradient patches?
4. **Integration complexity** — How to ensure all mechanisms work together coherently? How to avoid conflicting gradients?
5. **Measurement** — How to measure whether ambition is "flowing downhill" into service? What metrics indicate success?

### Positive Consequences

- **Systematic approach** to corruption prevention (not reactive)
- **Predictive design** (identify attractors before they emerge)
- **Coherent framework** connecting existing mechanisms
- **Meta-governance** capability (self-improving system)
- **Alignment with Core Principles** (especially #1, #2, #7)

### Risks

- **Over-engineering** — Risk of creating overly complex system
- **False confidence** — May create illusion of completeness when new attractors can always emerge
- **Measurement challenges** — Difficult to quantify gradient steepness and effectiveness
- **Cultural assumptions** — May depend on specific cultural contexts (though Core Principles are universal)
