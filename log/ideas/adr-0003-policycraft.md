# ADR-0003: Establishment of the Policycraft Profession
Status: Accepted  
Date: 2025-11-11

## Context
Without politicians, the implementation of Mandates must rely on skilled policy design. Current bureaucracies lack incentive alignment and performance metrics.

## Decision
Create a licensed **Policycraft profession** with open policy competitions, transparent evaluation, and performance-linked compensation.

## Rationale
- Encourages innovation and measurable success.  
- Reduces corruption by eliminating informal lobbying.  
- Promotes meritocracy and pride in public service.  

## Consequences
- Requires oversight boards and clear metrics.  
- Demands cultural shift in how “public service” is valued.  
- Enables modular and hybrid policy formation.

## Related
- Civic Mandate Economy Act §§4–6.  
- Civic Outcomes Ledger (performance transparency).
