# ADR-0003: Establishment of the Policycraft Profession
Status: Accepted  
Date: 2025-11-11

## Context
Without politicians, the implementation of Mandates must rely on skilled policy design. Current bureaucracies lack incentive alignment and performance metrics.

## Decision
Create a licensed **Policycraft profession** with open policy competitions, transparent evaluation, and performance-linked compensation.

## Rationale
- Encourages innovation and measurable success.  
- Reduces corruption by eliminating informal lobbying.  
- Promotes meritocracy and pride in public service.  

## Consequences
- Requires oversight boards and clear metrics.  
- Demands cultural shift in how “public service” is valued.  
- Enables modular and hybrid policy formation.

## Related
- Civic Mandate Economy Act §§4–6.  
- Civic Outcomes Ledger (performance transparency).

## Open Questions
- **Policycraft profession structure**: Do policy crafters need to be a licensed profession? Why? Weigh the cost/benefits of the system vs simply an open application. If the mandates and data are completely open, does this even need to be a Bureau, or could it just be open to the general public to submit policy proposals? Or perhaps a hybrid system where people could submit policies that people could vote on and/or policymakers could review. Maybe the public has a brilliant idea that would work better than anything the policymakers come up with. This could be especially valuable from specific institutions with deep knowledge of a domain like police officers who may think up policy solutions that a policymaker would never think of because they lack the on-the-ground institutional knowledge. If chosen in part of whole, the person's policy could be rewarded with money/fame/etc.
