# ADR-0001: Foundational Assumption of Human Nature
Status: Accepted  
Date: 2025-11-11

## Context
Past political ideologies (especially communism) failed by assuming people act altruistically. Stable systems must instead assume selfishness, error, and corruption as constants.

## Decision
Design all governance structures around the **axiom of human imperfection**: individuals, corporations, and administrators act in self-interest unless structurally aligned otherwise.

## Rationale
- Matches historical and psychological evidence.  
- Converts vice into virtue by aligning incentives.  
- Reduces reliance on moral character or cultural uniformity.  

## Alternatives Considered
1. Virtue-based governance (Plato’s philosopher-king) — historically failed.  
2. Communist altruism — empirically unstable.  
3. Total surveillance — effective but anti-freedom.  

## Consequences
- Permanent design principle: *assume corruption, verify honesty*.  
- Legitimizes capitalism-like mechanisms in governance.  
- Enables robust systems that harness ambition instead of fighting it.  

## Related
- Basis for all subsequent Acts and Amendments.  
- Precursor to **Civic Mandate Republic** design.
