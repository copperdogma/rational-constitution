# ADR-0001: Foundational Assumption of Human Nature
Status: Accepted  
Date: 2025-11-11

## Context
Past political ideologies (especially communism) failed by assuming people act altruistically. Stable systems must instead assume selfishness, error, and corruption as constants.

## Decision
Design all governance structures around the **axiom of human imperfection**: individuals, corporations, and administrators act in self-interest unless structurally aligned otherwise.

## Rationale
- Matches historical and psychological evidence.  
- Converts vice into virtue by aligning incentives.  
- Reduces reliance on moral character or cultural uniformity.  

## Alternatives Considered
1. Virtue-based governance (Plato’s philosopher-king) — historically failed.  
2. Communist altruism — empirically unstable.  
3. Total surveillance — effective but anti-freedom.  

## Consequences
- Permanent design principle: *assume corruption, verify honesty*.  
- Legitimizes capitalism-like mechanisms in governance.  
- Enables robust systems that harness ambition instead of fighting it.  

## Related
- Basis for all subsequent Acts and Amendments.  
- Precursor to **Civic Mandate Republic** design.

## Open Questions
- **Human nature constraints and inequality**: Freedom + private property = incentive to provide value for profit. That's good. But that incentive also rewards high-value individuals with more profit, leading to inequalities. Inequality drives a sense of unfairness = social unrest. So we need to find a way to balance the incentive with the social cost AND ensure people think the system is extremely fair/unbiased. i.e.: if another individual took the exact same actions they would get the same outcome. In our system we have a pervasive narrative that the system ISN'T fair, exacerbated by the fact it's about 10% unfair as their "proof" of 100% unfair. If we eliminate the actual unfairness by not allowing those unfair rules plus radical transparency we can remove the narrative's true foundation, hastening it's collapse or ideally it never starting as people believe in the system.
