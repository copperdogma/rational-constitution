# Justice Integration Queue

Same queue structure as corrections; populate items with notes, excerpts, and decisions as you triage.

DONE: 1. **Consolidated additions** – justice-aligned material awaiting placement.
DONE: 2. **Consolidated rationales** – supporting arguments and proofs to trace decisions.

3. **Your notes** – handwritten or ad-hoc thoughts that need classification.
4. **Structural refinements** – ideas about reorganizing justice principles.
5. **Incentive refinements** – adjustments that keep justice incentives aligned with the Core.
6. **Edge cases** – tricky scenarios or hypotheticals that stress-test the framework.
7. **Meta-principles** – overarching philosophies that influence justice design.
8. **Contradiction checks** – items needing cross-document verification for consistency.
