# Integrated Rationales (Justice Layer)

These rationales justify the **justice‑level** choices in the rights and sentencing architecture.  
They correspond to the same numbering used in the integrated additions.

## 1. Punishment as derogation of rights, imprisonment package & rights continuity

**Problem Exposed (Justice View)**  
- The slogan “the only punishment is confinement” was carrying too much weight:  
  - Legally, it meant only freedom of movement is removed.  
  - Rhetorically, it sounded like nothing else really changes, which is false inside a closed world with higher stakes.  
- Without an explicit rights‑continuity rule, critics could point to:  
  - old or disabled prisoners apparently being required to work just to eat;  
  - implicit loss of rights (voting, benefits, healthcare) “by virtue of imprisonment”;  
  - ambiguity over whether prisoners remain full citizens or become a special class.  
- “Same social contract” language was loose enough to be read as either trivial (“nothing changes”) or false (because the option‑space is clearly narrower inside).

**Resolution (Justice Rules)**  
- Define punishment at the justice layer as the lawful, proportional derogation of one or more rights in response to a proven offense.  
- Treat imprisonment as one such punishment type, consisting of:
  - derogation of freedom of movement, and
  - a standardized, narrowly tailored bundle of additional derogations explicitly defined in general law as necessary for secure confinement (privacy limits, controlled association, targeted surveillance, regulated possession, internal scheduling).  
- Make rights continuity explicit for the imprisonment modality:  
  - By default, only freedom of movement is derogated by imprisonment, plus any other rights explicitly removed in the sentence or by general law.  
  - Prisoners retain all other rights and social‑program benefits: pensions, retirement, disability, healthcare, etc.  
- Clarify that:  
  - The only core punishment is confinement (and any additional rights named in law/sentence).  
  - The “must provide value for essentials” rule is not a new punishment, just the same background social contract that applies to everyone.  
- Tighten “same social contract” to mean:  
  - continuity of negative‑rights structure (no unconditional right to subsistence),  
  - continuity of labour‑for‑necessities logic,  
  - without pretending the lived situation is identical.

**Key Arguments / Tradeoffs**  
- This preserves the elegance of “prison = citizen + restricted geography” without hand‑waving away the increased stakes of confinement.  
- Explicit continuity avoids a second, ad‑hoc rights regime for prisoners and makes edge cases (retirement, disability, welfare, etc.) resolve automatically: whatever is true outside is true inside.  
- It also answers coherence questions such as:  
  - “Do prisoners get free essentials?”  
  - “Must elderly or disabled prisoners work?”  
  - “Is labour itself coercive in this model?”  
  - “Does the state owe prisoners special provisions beyond what it owes any citizen?”  
- All are answered by the same rule applying inside and outside confinement; the justice system does not create a separate moral universe.  
- Tradeoff: if the wider society’s social contract is harsh, prison will reflect that harshness; if it is generous, prison inherits that generosity. The justice model is no longer a moral shield from the society’s own choices.

## 5. No death-traps & guaranteed survival paths — Justice Component

**Problem Exposed (Justice View)**  
- The core defence of the system is: “if you want to live, there is a viable, moral path to do so.”  
- That implicitly assumes:  
  - at least one live survival path always exists, and  
  - that path is not blocked by policy, pricing, or design.  
- Without an explicit **rights‑protective** safeguard, the architecture could drift into:  
  - jobs that exist on paper but are inaccessible or inadequate,  
  - price/wage combinations where you cannot stay fed and sheltered even with effort,  
  - configurations where “work for essentials” is impossible in practice while remaining legal in form.

**Resolution (Justice Axiom)**  
- Add a justice‑level axiom that, at all times:  
  - Every competent prisoner has at least one realistically viable, moral path to survival consistent with retained rights.  
  - The state may not, as an effect of confinement, remove the possibility of survival **in principle** for a competent prisoner who is willing to engage minimally.  

**Key Arguments / Tradeoffs**  
- This turns the “no state‑created death‑traps” intuition into a rights rule, not just a moral hope.  
- It gives oversight bodies a clear justice‑level test: “Did the architecture preserve a live, rights‑compatible survival path?”  
- Tradeoff: the system must be monitored and periodically recalibrated (work conditions, pay scales, prices), but that is the cost of keeping the punitive scope limited to confinement.

## 6. Competence, capacity, mental health & custodial fallback duties — Justice Component

**Problem Exposed (Justice View)**  
- The social‑contract defence (“if you refuse all options, that’s your choice”) only works for competent adults.  
- Hard cases include:  
  - severely mentally ill prisoners,  
  - cognitively impaired, demented, or otherwise incapacitated individuals,  
  - those in acute crisis where refusal is not truly autonomous.  
- Without a capacity framework, the justice architecture risks either:  
  - appearing to “let the mentally ill starve,” or  
  - collapsing into full paternalism where no prisoner’s refusal is ever respected.

**Resolution (Justice Rules)**  
- Introduce a competence/incapacity framework that mirrors outside standards:  
  - Competent prisoners are treated as full agents who can choose even self‑endangering courses (including hunger strikes), just like free competent citizens.  
  - Incapacitated prisoners are treated under the same involuntary‑treatment/protection standards that would apply outside (mental health law, guardianship, etc.).  
- Impose a **positive custodial duty** for incapacitated prisoners:  
  - The institution must ensure they are fed, housed, and medically treated until capacity is restored or a lawful end‑of‑life regime applies.  
- Require legally grounded, reviewable capacity assessments.

**Key Arguments / Tradeoffs**  
- This keeps the model’s core strength—respect for agency—intact for those who actually have agency, while not pretending that a psychotic or demented person “chose” starvation.  
- It aligns prison practice with existing medical/legal norms rather than inventing a contradictory standard just for inmates.  
- Tradeoff: the system must navigate messy, case‑by‑case clinical judgments, but that complexity already exists in any serious rights‑respecting regime.

## 7. Market oversight, moral review & deaths-from-non-engagement review — Justice Component

**Problem Exposed (Justice View)**  
- On paper, all constraints can be satisfied while, in practice, drift, neglect, or quiet abuses create:  
  - exploitative job mixes,  
  - wage/price imbalances,  
  - subtle barriers to charity or outside income,  
  - de facto death‑traps.  
- Without structured oversight and ex‑post review:  
  - there is no way to detect systemic failures early,  
  - the line between “self‑authored starvation” and “system‑caused harm” depends on ad hoc moral intuition.

**Resolution (Justice Oversight Requirement)**  
- Create an independent oversight body empowered to:  
  - audit whether confinement as implemented remains consistent with constitutional rights;  
  - review deaths or serious harms plausibly connected to refusal/non‑engagement;  
  - determine whether:  
    - the prisoner was competent,  
    - a viable, moral survival path existed,  
    - any rights‑based failures contributed.  
- Grant this body authority to mandate changes where systemic justice‑level violations occur.

**Key Arguments / Tradeoffs**  
- Provides the procedural backbone for rights continuity, the no‑death‑traps rule, and the capacity framework.  
- Prevents quiet drift back into coercive labour or starvation‑threat dynamics that violate the justice architecture.  
- Tradeoff: ongoing institutional cost and complexity, but this is the minimal price of making the justice model more than elegant theory.
