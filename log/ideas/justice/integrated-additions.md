# Integrated Additions (Justice Layer)

These additions modify or clarify the *sentencing framework*, *rights architecture*, and the *moral boundaries within which corrections must operate*. They do **not** address implementation details.

## 1. Rights continuity, explicit derogations & separation of punishment from economic life
**Type:** definitional fix / clarification

### Justice-Level Additions
- Only explicitly named rights may be derogated.
- Default: **confinement removes only freedom of movement**.
- No other rights are lost merely “by virtue of imprisonment.”
- Any additional derogations (communication, voting, association, etc.) require:
  - explicit statement in the sentence **or**
  - a general law that applies equally to all citizens in defined circumstances.
- Prisoners retain all civil rights, negative liberties, and social-program entitlements except:
  1. freedom of movement, and  
  2. any other rights explicitly derogated by sentence.
- Clarify that:
  - pensions, retirement benefits, disability support, healthcare, etc. continue without interruption.
  - retirement age, disability entitlements, and “no-work-required” conditions apply identically to imprisoned and free citizens.
- Codify: **Punishment = confinement only.**
- The labour-for-essentials structure is **not** punishment but continuation of society’s standard social contract.
- Define “same social contract” as:
  - continuity of negative-rights norms (no claim-right to subsistence),
  - continuity of value-for-essentials norms,
  - and recognition that confinement changes option-space but *not* the underlying rights logic.

## 5. No death-traps & guaranteed survival paths — Justice Component
**Type:** safeguard

### Justice-Level Additions
- The justice framework must forbid any custodial architecture that:
  - structurally eliminates all viable paths to survival, or
  - makes survival impossible *in principle* for a competent prisoner who engages minimally.
- This is encoded as a **rights-protective axiom**:  
  *The state may not, as an effect of confinement, remove the possibility of survival consistent with retained rights.*

## 6. Competence, capacity, mental health & custodial fallback duties — Justice Component
**Type:** new safeguard

### Justice-Level Additions
- Establish legal definitions of:
  - competent prisoner (capable of informed, voluntary decision-making),
  - incapacitated prisoner (e.g. psychosis, advanced dementia, severe impairment).
- Competent prisoners retain full agency, including the right to refuse work or food.
- Incapacitated prisoners fall under the same protective regimes that apply to free citizens (mental health law, guardianship, involuntary care where justified).
- The state has a **positive duty** to safeguard incapacitated prisoners (feeding, medical treatment) until capacity returns.
- Require legally grounded, reviewable capacity assessments.

## 7. Market oversight, moral review & deaths-from-non-engagement review — Justice Component
**Type:** structural safeguard

### Justice-Level Additions
- Create an independent oversight body empowered to:
  - ensure ongoing compliance with constitutional rights during confinement;
  - review deaths plausibly connected to refusal/non-engagement;
  - determine whether:
    - the prisoner was competent,
    - a viable survival path existed,
    - any rights-based failures contributed.
- This body has authority to mandate changes where systemic rights violations occur.
