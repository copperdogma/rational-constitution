# Justice Framework — Rights & Sentencing Architecture

## 1. Core Principle: Punishment as Derogation of Rights
A punishment is the lawful, proportional derogation of one or more rights in response to a proven offense.

Different crimes justify different derogations, as authorised in advance by general law, subject to:
- proportionality,
- respect for non‑derogable rights, and
- explicitness and reviewability in sentencing.

Imprisonment is **one** such punishment type.  
In principle it consists of:
- derogation of freedom of movement; plus
- a standard, narrowly tailored bundle of additional derogations explicitly defined in general law as necessary for secure confinement (e.g. limited privacy, controlled association, targeted surveillance, regulated possession, and internal scheduling).

Anything not listed in that bundle (or explicitly added by sentence) remains a retained right.
The Corrections system defines how this imprisonment package is implemented in practice.

## 2. Rights Continuity (Sentencing Principle)
Additions from combined discussion:

- Only explicitly named rights are derogated.  
- When imprisonment is chosen, the **default** is that only freedom of movement is removed by that punishment.  
- No further rights are lost “by virtue of imprisonment” as an implicit side‑effect.

A prisoner retains all rights held by a free citizen except those explicitly derogated.  
This includes:
- right to work
- right to earn and spend wages
- right to pensions, retirement, disability support, and healthcare
- right to participate in general social programmes
- right to refuse work
- right to refuse food
- right to make self-directed choices

Retirement, disability, and “no work required” conditions mirror the outside world:
- where a free citizen would not be expected or required to work to obtain essentials, an imprisoned citizen is under the same rule.

Prison is **not** a separate moral regime.  
Sentencing maintains continuity with the broader rights framework.

## 3. Rules for Derogating Rights
Derogation must be:
- explicit in sentencing
- minimal
- proportionate
- transparent
- challengeable
- reviewed under non-derogable rights protections

Movement-only derogation is the default unless specified otherwise.

Any further derogations (e.g. voting, communication, association) must:
- be expressly listed in the sentence or in general law that applies equally to all citizens in defined circumstances, and
- remain consistent with non‑derogable rights and proportionality standards.

For imprisonment specifically, the general law must:
- define a clear, standardized “imprisonment package” of derogations required for secure confinement; and
- ensure that all routine practices in prisons (search, surveillance, association limits, internal movement control) map to one of the authorised derogations in that package.

---

## 4. Confinement as the Sole Punitive Mechanism
Justice clarifies the relationship between punishment and economic life:

- The core punishment of imprisonment is loss of freedom of movement (plus any other explicitly listed rights).  
- The requirement to provide value for essentials is **not** a separate punishment; it is the continuation of the general social contract that applies to all citizens.
- “Same social contract” means:
  - continuity of negative-rights norms (no claim-right to subsistence), and
  - the labour‑for‑necessities logic that applies to everyone,
  not an assertion that the option-space inside is identical to outside.

The state must not introduce:
- forced labour  
- coerced deprivation  
- behavioural compulsion  
- economic coercion  
- additional derogations through operations

Punishment = confinement.  
All other constraints must arise from neutral implementation, not intent to punish.

---

## 5. No Death-Traps Principle
Confinement in a closed environment does **not** entitle the state to create “death‑trap” conditions or exploitative dependence.

Justice requires that:
- at all times, for any competent prisoner who minimally engages, there exists at least one realistically viable, moral path to secure basic necessities; and
- institutional rules, pricing, job design, and vendor policies must not evolve to a point where survival is impossible **in principle** for a willing, competent prisoner.

This encodes the “no state‑created death‑traps” axiom.

---

## 6. Competence, Capacity, and Mental Health
Justice distinguishes competent from incapacitated prisoners:

- **Competent**: capable of informed, voluntary decision‑making about work, food, and participation in the micro‑economy.  
- **Incapacitated**: unable to make such decisions due to severe mental illness, cognitive impairment, advanced dementia, or comparable conditions.

Principles:
- Competent prisoners may refuse work or food even to the point of death; such outcomes are treated as self‑authored choices within the social contract.
- Incapacitated prisoners cannot be treated as self‑authoring such outcomes.
- Prisoners who lack decision‑making capacity fall under the same protective and involuntary‑treatment regimes that would apply to free citizens.
- For incapacitated prisoners, the state has a positive custodial duty to ensure they are fed and medically treated as needed until capacity is restored.

Justice requires:
- regular, documented capacity assessments where there are signs of severe mental illness or inability to manage survival; and
- placement of this framework under Rights and Health/Administration, with cross‑references to any Mental Health and Oversight provisions.

---

## 7. Oversight and Challenge Mechanisms
Sentencing and rights derogation must have:
- judicial review
- public transparency
- ability to challenge improper additional coercion
- external oversight bodies ensuring state compliance

Systems whose structure can determine survival outcomes must also:
- support independent review of any death or serious harm plausibly associated with non‑engagement in the prison micro‑economy, and
- empower oversight bodies to order remedial changes where justice‑level principles (rights continuity, no death‑traps, capacity protections) have been violated.

---

## 8. External Authorities Are Not Moral Premises
This framework derives its legitimacy from the constitutional first principles of:
- agency and moral equality,
- reciprocity and non‑interference,
- predictability of law, and
- justified, proportionate enforcement.

References to external treaties, conventions, or institutional norms (e.g. UN instruments, regional human‑rights courts, soft‑law standards) may be informative or historically relevant but do **not** constitute moral arguments within this system.

Evaluating any punishment or custodial regime must therefore rely on:
- internal logical consistency,
- alignment with constitutional axioms,
- protection of agency and predictability, and
- avoidance of state‑authored harm.

Claims stand or fall on these grounds alone, not on appeals to external authority.

---

## 9. Implementation Risk as a General Governance Constraint
The moral evaluation of this justice and corrections model does not assume perfect implementation or incorruptible administrators.

Implementation risk is a universal property of all institutions:
- courts, legislatures, markets, regulators, and enforcement bodies can all fail under corruption, incompetence, or bad incentives.

Within this constitution, that risk is addressed by:
- limiting discretionary power,
- structuring incentives to minimize abuse,
- requiring transparency, oversight, and legibility for state action.

The proper question for any design, including imprisonment and corrections, is therefore whether:
- its incentives are healthier than current alternatives,
- its failure modes are narrower and more controllable, and
- its mechanisms align with the constitutional principles of agency, reciprocity, non‑interference, and predictability.

The model makes no claim to immunity from misuse; it aims to be more coherent, incentive‑aligned, and resistant to abuse than existing structures.

---

## 10. Iterative Refinement Over Preemptive Over‑Engineering
This framework does not attempt to pre‑solve every hypothetical failure mode or edge case in advance.

Instead, it:
- establishes clear principles and guardrails,
- defines minimal, coherent mechanisms that satisfy those principles, and
- relies on measured feedback, oversight, and future amendments to address real‑world problems as they arise.

Possible issues that have not yet materialised should inform monitoring and review, not automatic expansion of coercive powers or complexity.  
The design aim is to remain as simple as possible while reality demands no more.
