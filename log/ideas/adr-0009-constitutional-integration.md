# ADR-0009: Integration of Executive, Judiciary, and Transparency Reforms
Status: Accepted  
Date: 2025-11-11

## Context
The original Rational Constitution contained classical parliamentary mechanics.  
Subsequent acts and discussions produced improved frameworks — a Chancellor model, transparency ledger, and rebalanced judiciary — requiring direct integration rather than appendices.

## Decision
Amend the main Constitution to:
1. Replace the prior executive with an elected **Chancellor** and **Executive Council**.  
2. Define **retroactive audit** and **ledger transparency** as constitutional duties.  
3. Rebalance **judicial scope** to focus solely on rights and legality.  
4. Add a new **Transparency Article** codifying open data and audit cycles.  
5. Integrate cross-references to the **Externality Principle** and **Civic Mandate Economy** for fiscal consistency.

## Rationale
- Embeds accountability and transparency at the constitutional level.  
- Simplifies hierarchy; reduces reliance on legislative confidence votes.  
- Aligns executive legitimacy with measured performance rather than charisma.  
- Ensures judicial restraint and procedural clarity.  
- Creates a unified system between acts and constitution.

## Consequences
- Supersedes the earlier “Constitutional Amendment Bundle.”  
- Establishes permanent roles for the Chancellor, Executive Council, and Civic Outcomes Ledger.  
- Streamlines references to subordinate acts for better coherence.

## Supersedes
Constitutional Amendment Bundle (unratified draft).
