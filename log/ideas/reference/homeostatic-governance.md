# Homeostatic Governance Framework (Summary Notes)
from: https://chatgpt.com/c/6935bf22-26e4-8326-8887-42b8fadd18ac

1. Mandate of Social Homeostasis

All major policy domains must be designed to maintain stable societal conditions through adaptive, negative-feedback regulation.
Policies must respond to deviations by reducing them, not amplifying them.

⸻

2. Operating Context Requirement

Every policy must explicitly state its intended normal operating conditions and the assumptions under which it functions (population scale, resource load, economic context, etc.).

⸻

3. Stress Indicators & Triggered Modes

Policies must define:
•	Clear, citizen-comprehensible indicators of stress (e.g., ratios, percentages, surveys).
•	Threshold triggers that activate predefined stabilizing responses.
•	Hysteresis/buffer zones, so small fluctuations don’t trigger responses.

Numbers are not constitutional; clarity and transparency are.

⸻

4. Hierarchical Feedback Structure

Homeostatic systems must operate at three levels:
1.	Local loops (domain-specific stabilization)
2.	Sector governors (coordination across related domains)
3.	National stabilizer (prevents conflicting or simultaneous multi-domain triggers)

This hierarchy prevents cascade failure and ensures coherent system-wide stability.

⸻

5. Negative Feedback Requirement

All homeostatic responses must use negative feedback — measures that counteract deviations and push the system back toward equilibrium.
Positive feedback loops are prohibited except in explicitly bounded, short-duration cases.

⸻

6. Anti-Cascade Clause (critical constitutional protection)

No system of homeostatic regulation may cause broad systemic instability or simultaneous multi-domain trigger activation.
The stabilizer layer may pause, sequence, or override triggers to maintain coherence.

⸻

7. Damping, Rate Limits, and Safe Activation

Triggered responses must:
•	Activate gradually
•	Be capped in intensity
•	Avoid interacting with multiple domains at once
•	Include evaluation windows before escalation

This prevents runaway corrections or oscillatory policy swings.

⸻

8. Policy Rollback & Evolution Mechanism

Each policy must include:
•	A defined evaluation period
•	Automatic rollback conditions if it destabilizes or underperforms
•	Comparison against previous known-good versions
•	The ability for policymakers to propose improved successors

This creates an evolutionary policy ecosystem.

⸻

9. Citizen Outcome Prioritization (“Slider Model”)

Citizens vote on desired outcome priorities, not laws.
These outcome vectors adjust:
•	Policy setpoints
•	Resource allocation
•	Tolerance bands

Policymakers then compete to design systems that meet these values within the homeostatic framework.

⸻

10. Transparency & Comprehensibility Requirement

All thresholds, triggers, and indicators must:
•	Be understandable to the average citizen
•	Use simple ratios or qualitative categories
•	Be publicly documented
•	Be stable over time unless deliberately revised

This preserves citizen oversight and legitimacy.

⸻

One-Line Philosophy Statement

Government becomes a stability engine: citizens set direction, policymakers design the architecture, and homeostatic systems maintain balance automatically.
