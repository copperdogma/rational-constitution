# ADR-0005: Chancellor as Limited Executive Head
Status: Accepted  
Date: 2025-11-11

## Context
Eliminating traditional politicians creates a leadership vacuum for diplomacy, emergency action, and symbolic unity. However, returning to a strong presidency risks corruption and authoritarian drift.

## Decision
Establish a **Chancellor**: an elected, single-term executive figurehead with limited powers, subject to mandatory retroactive audit (30/60/90 rule).

## Rationale
- Preserves international representation and ceremonial legitimacy.  
- Allows rapid emergency response under defined oversight.  
- Prevents concentration of power through fixed term and audit transparency.  
- Symbolically embodies the nation without legislative influence.  

## Alternatives Considered
1. Rotating executive council — rejected (lack of continuity).  
2. Collective leadership (Swiss model) — rejected (diffused accountability).  
3. Technocratic directorate — rejected (no democratic legitimacy).  

## Consequences
- Creates a stable public symbol of statehood.  
- Enables quick action during crises with full traceability.  
- Requires strong internal auditing (Metrics Bureau + citizen review).  
- Limited political incentive structure → minimal corruption risk.

## Open Questions
- **Executive Council accountability**: What measurable selection, rotation, and performance metrics ensure the nonpartisan expert council remains aligned and auditable over time?
