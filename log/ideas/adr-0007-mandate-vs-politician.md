# ADR-0007: Replacing Politicians with Public Mandates
Status: Accepted  
Date: 2025-11-11

## Context
Representative democracy relies on elected politicians who often act in self-interest, seeking reelection and power rather than societal good. Eliminating politicians entirely requires a new democratic interface.

## Decision
Replace politicians with **Public Mandates** — collective, measurable goals citizens approve directly. Policy professionals execute them; outcomes are continuously measured.

## Rationale
- Removes incentive for demagoguery and corruption.  
- Simplifies governance: citizens vote for outcomes, not personalities.  
- Allows technocratic efficiency while retaining democratic legitimacy.  

## Alternatives Considered
1. AI voting proxies — promising but premature.  
2. Direct democracy (referenda) — too slow and uninformed.  
3. Bureaucratic governance — lacks democratic input.  

## Consequences
- Ends personality-based politics.  
- Makes democracy an ongoing, quantitative process.  
- Requires robust information environment (CIO, Metrics Bureau).  
- May reduce emotional engagement in politics — mitigated by strong civic culture.
