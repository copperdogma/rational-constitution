# ADR-0007: Replacing Politicians with Public Mandates
Status: Accepted  
Date: 2025-11-11

## Context
Representative democracy relies on elected politicians who often act in self-interest, seeking reelection and power rather than societal good. Eliminating politicians entirely requires a new democratic interface.

## Decision
Replace politicians with **Public Mandates** — collective, measurable goals citizens approve directly. Policy professionals execute them; outcomes are continuously measured.

## Rationale
- Removes incentive for demagoguery and corruption.  
- Simplifies governance: citizens vote for outcomes, not personalities.  
- Allows technocratic efficiency while retaining democratic legitimacy.  

## Alternatives Considered
1. AI voting proxies — promising but premature.  
2. Direct democracy (referenda) — too slow and uninformed.  
3. Bureaucratic governance — lacks democratic input.  

## Consequences
- Ends personality-based politics.  
- Makes democracy an ongoing, quantitative process.  
- Requires robust information environment (CIO, Metrics Bureau).  
- May reduce emotional engagement in politics — mitigated by strong civic culture.

## Open Questions
- **Policymaker/public mismatch**: If the public is just specifying OUTCOMES, how would this handle something like the "trans girls in sports" issue? That's a solidly political issue. Would the outcome be "full trans women=women equality?" Is that an outcome even? Is this a gray area that breaks my system? Are all things the public wants to see outcomes? I feel like a lot of them are "approaches to outcomes." For instance housing cost. Maybe everyone votes on an outcome of affordable housing. Building 2x the number of houses would massively drive down house prices, making people without houses thrilled and rich people who just lost half the value of their houses furious. How do we avoid tyranny of the majority/minority policies? They CAN provide the desired outcome efficiently in many cases. Even satisfaction surveys don't really cover it because they encourage tyranny of the majority. So then you get DEI-like over-weighting of minorities to compensate which is inherently political. TRICKY.
