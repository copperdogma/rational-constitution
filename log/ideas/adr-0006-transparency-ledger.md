# ADR-0006: Radical Transparency and the Civic Outcomes Ledger
Status: Accepted  
Date: 2025-11-11

## Context
Opacity in government breeds corruption and erodes public trust. Past transparency efforts (FOIA, open data portals) were partial and inconsistent.

## Decision
Mandate **Radical Transparency**: every government decision, dataset, model, and outcome must be logged in the **Civic Outcomes Ledger**, a version-controlled, machine-readable public record.

## Rationale
- Converts secrecy into verifiable data.  
- Enables citizen and AI oversight.  
- Provides long-term institutional memory.  
- Replaces propaganda with measurable facts.  

## Alternatives Considered
1. Traditional FOIA systems — rejected (reactive, partial).  
2. Annual government reporting — rejected (outdated, easily gamed).  
3. Cryptographic voting ledger — compatible but limited to ballots.  

## Consequences
- All administrative actions permanently recorded.  
- Redactions allowed only for security, with automatic 5-year review.  
- Creates massive data corpus for governance analytics.  
- Public learns directly from government data rather than filtered media.

- **Civic Mandate Economy Act**, §10.  
- **Constitutional Amendment Bundle**, §3.

## Open Questions
- **Constitutional principle**: Sunlight is the best disinfectant: make this a constitutional principle.
