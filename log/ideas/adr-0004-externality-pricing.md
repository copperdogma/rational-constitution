# ADR-0004: Externality Pricing as Core Fiscal Mechanism
Status: Accepted  
Date: 2025-11-11

## Context
Modern economies routinely underprice environmental and social costs, leading to unsustainable behaviors and market distortions. Traditional regulation or central planning introduces inefficiency and corruption.

## Decision
Adopt a constitutional mechanism for **Externality Pricing** — taxing negative externalities in proportion to their measurable harm, with progressive rebates ensuring net equity.

## Rationale
- Internalizes true social costs into market behavior.  
- Encourages innovation by allowing any solution that reduces the taxed harm.  
- Simplifies governance by removing prescriptive regulation.  
- Ensures fairness through rebate structure (revenue-neutral and progressive).  

## Alternatives Considered
1. Regulatory bans — rejected for rigidity and enforcement cost.  
2. Voluntary carbon markets — rejected for manipulation and inconsistency.  
3. Universal basic income — complementary but not directly corrective.  

## Consequences
- Shifts tax burden from labor/income to harm.  
- Incentivizes clean innovation.  
- Creates a stable fiscal source that may replace other taxes.  
- Requires continuous measurement and periodic recalibration by Metrics Bureau.
