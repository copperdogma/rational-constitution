# ADR-0002: Governance Model Selection
Status: Accepted  
Date: 2025-11-11

## Context
Existing democratic systems fail primarily through corruption, information distortion, and misaligned incentives. Traditional representative systems rely on moral virtue and are prone to capture by wealth or demagoguery.

## Decision
Adopt a **Civic Mandate Republic** model where citizens define goals (Public Mandates) and professional administrators implement them under transparent, metric-based accountability.

## Rationale
- Aligns with observed human behavior: people act out of self-interest.  
- Converts incentives into competitive forces for public benefit.  
- Removes power-seeking roles, reducing corruption opportunities.  
- Retains democratic legitimacy through direct voting on outcomes.  

## Alternatives Considered
1. AI-based direct democracy — rejected (premature technology).
2. Traditional party system — rejected (inherently corruptible).
3. Technocracy without democracy — rejected (elitist drift).

## Consequences
- Eliminates need for political class.  
- Requires new institutions for metrics, transparency, and execution.  
- Creates need for symbolic executive figure (→ Chancellor).

## Supersedes
Initial drafts of “Post-Politician Democracy” and “AI Proxy Governance.”
