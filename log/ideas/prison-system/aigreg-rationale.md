Reasoning Behind Essential Additions
	1.	Label: Precise meaning of “punishment = confinement only”
	•	Problem Exposed:
The original slogan “the only punishment is confinement” was being used in two senses:
	1.	a legal sense (only movement is derogated), and
	2.	a phenomenological/moral sense (“nothing else really changes”).
The debate showed that in a closed, state-built world, confinement necessarily raises the stakes of refusal and changes the option topology in ways that are morally relevant, even if no other formal rights are removed. This created an apparent contradiction between the slogan and the actual effects of the design.
	•	Resolution:
The fix is to lock the slogan to its legal meaning: the only right expressly removed by law is freedom of movement; all other rights and norms remain. The harsher consequences of refusal are explicitly reclassified as consequences of confinement rather than new, independent punishments. This keeps the branding while preventing it from being read as “nothing else changes.”
	•	Key Arguments / Tradeoffs:
	•	One side argued that allowing death by prolonged refusal inside a sealed institution made “confinement-only” false in any ordinary sense.
	•	The other side replied that “punishment” should be defined strictly in terms of formal rights derogation, not every downstream effect.
	•	The compromise is to keep the slogan but nail down its meaning so it no longer implies full lived equivalence with free life.
	•	Status: resolved.
	2.	Label: Closed-world architectural duties
	•	Problem Exposed:
Throughout the debate, both sides assumed that the prison would: provide at least one moral job, enforce fair wages and prices, allow vendors and charity, avoid artificial scarcity, etc. But these duties were not spelled out in the proposal. Without explicit articulation, the same formal structure could be instantiated as a coercive “company town” that weaponizes dependency, contradicting the stated principles.
	•	Resolution:
Elevate those assumptions into a clear list of architectural duties that bind the state because it runs a closed world. This makes non-exploitation and fairness enforceable within the model, not just rhetorically presumed.
	•	Key Arguments / Tradeoffs:
	•	The critic argued that closed-world dependence gives the jailer structural power over every aspect of survival.
	•	The defender already accepted that this structural power creates extra duties (no profit, moral jobs, fair pricing) but had not codified them.
	•	Formalizing these duties does not change the core framework; it simply guards against “bad implementations” that would hollow out the normative claims.
	•	Status: resolved.
	3.	Label: Non-weaponization of deprivation
	•	Problem Exposed:
A central worry was that, in a closed system, any control over food, wages, or prices can easily become de facto coercion, even without overt threats. The proposal said the state may not exploit dependence, but did not concretely specify what “exploit” forbids, leaving ambiguity about whether deprivation could be used informally as leverage (e.g., lowering wages to force compliance).
	•	Resolution:
Add an explicit constraint: essentials and their pricing cannot be manipulated in order to punish, coerce, or extract obedience beyond confinement. This draws a hard line between:
	•	permitted consequences of self-authored refusal, and
	•	forbidden state-created deprivation patterns.
	•	Key Arguments / Tradeoffs:
	•	One side repeatedly distinguished between “letting the consequences of your own choices play out” and “rigging the environment so deprivation is a hidden punishment tool.”
	•	The other side agreed verbally that exploitation was banned but had not specified operational tests for exploitation.
	•	Writing non-weaponization into the market rules keeps the negative-rights stance intact while preventing the architecture from being repurposed as a pressure device.
	•	Status: resolved.
	4.	Label: No-death-traps & viable survival paths
	•	Problem Exposed:
The critic pressed on a key point: for the state to say “we’re not killing you or wrongfully letting you die,” survival must be genuinely possible within the rules. That requires at least one viable moral job and open charity channels. If the architecture allowed situations where, in practice or principle, nobody could earn enough or receive help, then the system would be functionally lethal and contradict its own claim not to be the killer.
	•	Resolution:
Add a safeguard that survival must always be possible in principle and realistically achievable for a competent inmate who minimally engages — via jobs and/or charity. This turns an implicit assumption into a hard design requirement and rules out impossible-survival scenarios as invalid implementations.
	•	Key Arguments / Tradeoffs:
	•	The defender already insisted that at least one moral, sufficient job exists and that charity is allowed; the critic pointed out these were not yet constitutionalized.
	•	Without this clause, “die by refusal” could conceal cases where refusal is only a small part of the causal chain because the architecture made success practically unattainable.
	•	The safeguard preserves the right-respecting, responsibility-preserving intent while ensuring the architecture itself is never fatal by design.
	•	Status: resolved.
	5.	Label: Competence and mental-health handling
	•	Problem Exposed:
Everyone agreed that “death by refusal” is only morally acceptable for competent adults. But in practice, prisoners include many who are traumatised, addicted, depressed, psychotic, or cognitively impaired. Without an explicit capacity regime, the system risks treating deaths of non-competent inmates as autonomous choices, which would violate its own autonomy/incapacity distinction and undercut the “we don’t kill / we don’t wrongfully let die” claim.
	•	Resolution:
Add a clear rule that ties the prison’s handling of capacity and severe mental illness to the same standards as outside (involuntary treatment, holds, etc.), and state that “refusal” counts as self-authored only when competence has been properly established. This channels borderline cases into the mental-health framework instead of the “your choice” bucket.
	•	Key Arguments / Tradeoffs:
	•	The critic argued that in real populations, “competent but barely” is a large, fuzzy category, and deaths in that band are morally fraught.
	•	The defender accepted that incapacity must be treated differently but had not built the external mental-health regime into the model.
	•	This safeguard retains the hard line on responsibility for truly competent refusal while preventing the system from quietly abandoning those whose agency is seriously compromised.
	•	Status: partially resolved, needs future refinement (details of capacity assessment and thresholds would still need to be worked out in policy/legislation).
	6.	Label: Review of deaths from non-engagement
	•	Problem Exposed:
Even with competence rules and architectural duties, there remained a practical risk: the system could start treating all deaths involving non-engagement as “their choice” without checking whether the preconditions (competence, viable paths, non-rigged environment) were actually satisfied. This would create a gap between the theory (no wrongful deaths) and operational reality.
	•	Resolution:
Require that any death plausibly related to non-engagement trigger a structured review focused on competence and architecture (were moral options present and non-rigged?). This translates the high-level axioms into a concrete oversight mechanism.
	•	Key Arguments / Tradeoffs:
	•	The critic stressed that classification (“self-authored” vs “system failure”) can’t be left to ad hoc moral intuition.
	•	The defender wanted to avoid turning the prison into a welfare institution yet accepted the need to ensure that no hidden coercion or design failure was at work.
	•	A mandatory review is a minimal, procedural safeguard that doesn’t add new rights but enforces the ones already endorsed.
	•	Status: resolved.
	7.	Label: “Same social contract” phrasing
	•	Problem Exposed:
“Same social contract” was doing too much work rhetorically. It was used to suggest that prisoners and free citizens live under substantively identical conditions except for movement, which is false once you account for closed-world dependence and a single institutional ecosystem. This over-claim made the model vulnerable to charges of bad faith or inconsistency, even though the underlying intent was only to preserve the norm (“no unconditional right to sustenance”).
	•	Resolution:
Narrow the phrase to mean continuity of negative-rights norms and labour-for-necessities logic (no claim-right to subsistence) while explicitly conceding that the lived environment and stakes are different because of confinement. This preserves the normative point without implying full phenomenological equivalence.
	•	Key Arguments / Tradeoffs:
	•	The critic argued that identical rules applied in radically different environments do not constitute the “same contract” in any meaningful sense.
	•	The defender’s real aim was to say “we don’t give you new welfare rights inside,” not to deny that the stakes change.
	•	Tightening the language avoids confusion and lets the proposal be judged on what it actually claims: rule continuity under a more constrained, but still non-exploitative, environment.
	•	Status: resolved.
