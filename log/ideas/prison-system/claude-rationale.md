Reasoning Behind Essential Additions
	1.	Label: Rights continuity and benefit inheritance
	•	Problem Exposed:
	•	The original framing emphasised that only freedom of movement is removed, but it was not explicit which other rights persist in practice. This left ambiguity around pensions, mandatory retirement, disability benefits, and healthcare, and raised concrete edge cases such as a very elderly prisoner apparently having to work to eat.
	•	Resolution:
	•	Adding an explicit rights-continuity clause that states: imprisonment derogates only freedom of movement (and any rights expressly specified in the sentence), while all other civil, political, and social rights remain, including eligibility for retirement, disability support, and healthcare. This is anchored in the Rights section and cross-linked to the Sentencing framework.
	•	Key Arguments / Tradeoffs:
	•	The conversation showed that the proposal’s moral appeal hinges on symmetry between free and imprisoned citizens and on “confinement-only” punishment. Without a formal continuity rule, that symmetry is unstable, and administrators could silently strip benefits that society treats as rights outside (e.g. retirement). The tradeoff is that this removes some punitive “harshness” (e.g. forcing the very old or disabled to work), but it preserves the proposal’s own core axiom and automatically handles edge cases like post-labour economies or ageing prisoners.
	•	Status: resolved
	2.	Label: Moral micro-market specification
	•	Problem Exposed:
	•	The idea of a “moral micro-market” was central but underspecified: there was no concrete standard for what counts as a moral job, how high wages must be, how essentials are priced, or how to prevent the state from turning prisoner labour into a profit centre. This opened the door to exploitative scenarios (low wages, high prices, long hours) that would effectively recreate forced labour and dark incentives.
	•	Resolution:
	•	The addition requires: at least one available job that meets clear moral criteria (safe, rights-respecting, within typical abilities), often more; pay at or above a benchmark comparable to minimum wage outside; pricing of essentials so that a reasonable workload suffices to cover them; and a prohibition on state or contractor profit from prisoner labour beyond cost recovery. These are formalised in the Market section.
	•	Key Arguments / Tradeoffs:
	•	Both sides converged that the model only avoids slavery-like dynamics if work is genuinely voluntary and not structurally rigged. Explicit standards prevent underpaying and overcharging as a way to coerce labour, and remove perverse incentives to incarcerate for revenue. The tradeoff is fiscal: the state may need to subsidise operations instead of extracting value, but this is consistent with the claim that incarceration should not be a profit-driven enterprise.
	•	Status: resolved
	3.	Label: Internal and external alternatives to state employment
	•	Problem Exposed:
	•	Critics argued that if the state is effectively the only employer and vendor, then “work to live” collapses into “obey the state or die,” even with fair wages and prices. Analogies like the locked basement or private island showed that a single actor controlling all survival channels looks coercive, regardless of nominal fairness, and undermines the claim that the prison market mirrors the free world.
	•	Resolution:
	•	The addition requires that, subject to safety: (a) prisoners can form or join internal co-ops and businesses, (b) engage in regulated but real prisoner-to-prisoner trade, and (c) receive funds or in-kind support from family, friends, and independent charities. These create non-state pathways to meet the same “provide value → get essentials” contract.
	•	Key Arguments / Tradeoffs:
	•	The reasoning was that in free society, people rarely rely on a single employer or provider; they can switch jobs, rely on family, charitable aid, informal economies, etc. To avoid a de facto monopoly, the prison must permit analogous alternative channels inside the walls. This reduces structural coercion and aligns the internal market with the external social contract. The tradeoffs are complexity and security overhead: internal economies and external support require regulation, oversight, and some tolerance for messiness.
	•	Status: partially resolved, needs future refinement (for detailed governance and security design)
	4.	Label: Capacity and mental-health threshold
	•	Problem Exposed:
	•	A recurring tension concerned prisoners with severe depression, psychosis, dementia, or borderline intellectual functioning who might be unable, in practice, to organise work, engage the market, or decide about food, yet might not fit into a simplistic “everyone must work or starve” model. Without a formal capacity concept, the system risks treating impaired non-participation as a “voluntary choice,” undermining its autonomy-based justification.
	•	Resolution:
	•	The change introduces a capacity framework analogous to those used outside: prisoners whose mental or cognitive condition substantially impairs understanding or engagement are deemed not fully competent for survival decisions and must be shifted into a care regime with guaranteed essentials, rather than subject to the work-for-essentials requirement. Periodic clinical assessment is mandated to re-evaluate status.
	•	Key Arguments / Tradeoffs:
	•	The key argument was that autonomy-based models must distinguish between competent self-direction and impaired agency. For the former, hard choices (even self-destructive ones) remain theirs; for the latter, the state (or health system) acquires a care duty. This mirrors outside practice (disability benefits, involuntary treatment, guardianship) and prevents the system from misclassifying incapacity as “voluntary starvation.” The tradeoffs are administrative complexity, possible gaming of the system, and the need for robust mental-health infrastructure.
	•	Status: resolved conceptually; partially resolved in practice (requires detailed procedural design)
	5.	Label: Non-instrumental deprivation rule
	•	Problem Exposed:
	•	A major concern was that, even if the basic contract is “provide value → get essentials,” administrators could manipulate access to work or alter prices and conditions as informal punishment, turning deprivation into a behavioural lever: “work this job / obey this order or we quietly make it impossible for you to afford food.” This would reintroduce coercive labour under another name.
	•	Resolution:
	•	The addition explicitly bans using access to essentials or work opportunities as a disciplinary instrument beyond what applies to free citizens. Deprivation arising from non-payment must flow only from neutral, pre-set rules of the market (shared with free citizens in structure), not from ad hoc administrative decisions intended to compel specific behaviours.
	•	Key Arguments / Tradeoffs:
	•	The reasoning was that the system’s moral defence depends on deprivation being a side-effect of the same social contract that governs free citizens, not a targeted punishment or threat. This rule draws a clear line between: “you chose not to engage with fair opportunities” and “we are tightening the screws to force you.” The tradeoff is reduced disciplinary flexibility for staff, who must rely on other sanctions (loss of privileges, segregation, etc.) that do not weaponise survival.
	•	Status: resolved
	6.	Label: Safety vs. economic restriction separation
	•	Problem Exposed:
	•	Critics argued that prisons typically impose many additional restrictions (e.g. on gardening, tools, trade, informal economies) that are not logically required by confinement alone. If such measures are used to narrow economic options rather than to address concrete safety risks, the claim that “only movement is removed” becomes inaccurate, and economic controls become a hidden extension of punishment.
	•	Resolution:
	•	The change requires that limits on internal economic activity be justified exclusively on safety and security grounds, documented as such, and not used to reduce survival options for punitive, economic, or administrative convenience. This maintains the distinction between the single core punishment (loss of movement) and safety-driven constraints, and constrains the latter to a narrow justification.
	•	Key Arguments / Tradeoffs:
	•	The key argument was that the model’s architecture depends on confinement being the only intentional rights removal, with other restrictions being strictly instrumental to safety. Explicitly separating safety justification from economic control prevents quiet drift toward broader, undeclared punishments. The tradeoff is an increased burden of documentation and oversight, and some loss of discretionary control for administrators who might otherwise restrict activities for non-safety reasons.
	•	Status: partially resolved, needs future refinement (specifying oversight mechanisms and review standards)
