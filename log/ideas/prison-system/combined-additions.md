Prison System Essential Additions - Combined
----------------------------------------------

Date: 2025-11-14

These are the combined, de-duplicated additions from the following documents: @aigreg-additions.md, @claude-additions.md, @gemini-additions.md, @grok-additions.md



1. Rights continuity, explicit derogations & separation of punishment from economic life

Type: definitional fix / clarification

Change Needed:
Add to the Rights / Principles / Sentencing sections that:
	•	Only explicitly named rights are derogated.
	•	By default, only freedom of movement is removed by imprisonment.
	•	Any other rights (e.g. voting, communication, association) can be removed only if they are expressly derogated in the sentence or by general law that applies equally to all citizens in defined circumstances.
	•	No further rights are lost “by virtue of imprisonment” as an implicit side-effect.
	•	Full rights continuity & benefit inheritance.
	•	Prisoners retain all civil rights, negative liberties, and social-program entitlements that free citizens do, except:
	1.	freedom of movement, and
	2.	any additional rights explicitly removed by sentence.
	•	Explicitly enumerate that this includes: pensions, retirement benefits, disability support, healthcare, and any other general social programs.
	•	Retirement, disability, and “no work required” conditions mirror the outside.
	•	Where a free citizen would not be expected or required to work (e.g. reaching pension age, qualifying disability, other social entitlements), an imprisoned citizen is under the same rule: they are not required to work to obtain essentials.
	•	Clarify “punishment = confinement only” and the “same social contract”.
	•	State that the only core punishment of imprisonment is loss of freedom of movement (plus any other explicitly listed rights).
	•	The requirement to provide value for essentials is not a separate punishment; it is the continuation of the general social contract that applies to all citizens.
	•	Define “same social contract” as:
	•	continuity of negative-rights norms (no claim-right to subsistence), and
	•	the labour-for-necessities logic that applies to everyone,
not an assertion that the option-space inside is identical to outside.
	•	Acknowledge that confinement legitimately raises the stakes of total refusal, even though the underlying norm is unchanged.
	•	No sentencing to “forced labour” as such.
	•	Courts sentence only:
	•	confinement (and any explicitly named additional derogations),
	•	within which the ordinary, rights-respecting market logic operates.
	•	“Forced labour” is not a lawful sentence; any work is part of the voluntary micro-economy, not an additional coercive punishment.

2. Closed-world moral micro-market & architectural duties

Type: clarification / constraint

Change Needed:
In the Architecture / Market / Governance sections, define the state’s duties in a closed environment:
	•	Physically safe, non-degrading environment.
	•	Maintain a facility that is physically safe and does not, by design, put prisoners in life-threatening conditions independent of their choices.
	•	Moral micro-market requirements.
The internal economy must:
	•	Guarantee at least one “moral/reasonable” job for every work-capable prisoner, meaning work that:
	•	does not violate their rights,
	•	is not degrading or cruel, and
	•	is of a kind a free citizen could reasonably accept.
	•	Offer wages and prices such that a reasonably diligent worker can, from that work alone, cover basic essentials (food, water, basic shelter, basic clothing).
	•	Prohibit extraction of net profit from prisoner labour beyond genuine cost recovery for running the facility and micro-economy.
	•	Market integrity & supplier-of-last-resort duty.
	•	Essentials (food, water, basic shelter, basic clothing) must always be obtainable at fair prices.
	•	Where external vendors or employers are available, prisoners may work for or buy from them, subject only to concrete, narrowly tailored security limits.
	•	If external supply or employment fails in practice, the state (or its contractor) must act as employer/supplier of last resort, still bound by the same fair wages, fair prices, and no-exploitative-profit constraints.
	•	No artificial scarcity or hidden economic control.
	•	Explicitly forbid artificial scarcity, arbitrary caps, or manipulation of the internal economy to increase dependence or leverage over prisoners.
	•	Any restriction on economic activity must be justified by security (e.g. contraband, gang financing), not by revenue, convenience, or desire for control.

3. External resources & alternatives to state employment

Type: clarification / new safeguard

Change Needed:
In the Market / Finance / Rights sections, specify that:
	•	Prisoners may meet their costs from outside resources.
	•	Prisoners are allowed to pay for food, lodging, and other essentials via:
	•	pre-existing savings,
	•	any lawful ongoing outside income, and
	•	voluntary payments from family, friends, charities, or other third parties.
	•	There is no penalty for a prisoner who chooses not to work when their obligations are covered by lawful outside resources.
	•	Alternatives to state employment.
	•	Subject to concrete, reviewable safety constraints, prisoners may:
	•	work for vetted non-state entities (e.g. private firms, co-ops, NGOs) under monitored conditions;
	•	participate in internal enterprises that are not under exclusive state control, so long as these also meet the moral work standards.
	•	The framework should avoid making the state the sole employer where genuine, safe alternatives exist.

4. Non-weaponization of essentials & non-instrumental deprivation

Type: constraint

Change Needed:
In the Market / Discipline / Administration sections, add explicit prohibitions:
	•	Essentials cannot be used as a disciplinary tool.
	•	Access to essentials (food, water, basic shelter, basic clothing), their prices, job availability, or account balances may not be modified as a disciplinary measure for rule-breaking.
	•	No use of price hikes, rationing, or artificial scarcity of essentials as a behavioural lever.
	•	Discipline must target non-essentials.
	•	Disciplinary measures operate through loss or restriction of non-essential privileges (recreation, entertainment, optional amenities, etc.), segregation where necessary for safety, or other proportionate rights-compatible tools.
	•	The “value-for-essentials” structure remains neutral and unaffected by day-to-day behavioural discipline, preserving the claim that deprivation is never state-weaponized.

5. No death-traps & guaranteed viable survival paths

Type: new safeguard

Change Needed:
In the Rights / Architecture / Market sections, add an axiom that:
	•	At all times, for any competent prisoner who minimally engages, there must be:
	•	at least one realistically viable, moral job that can earn enough to secure basic necessities via the micro-economy; and
	•	fair access to charity and outside support in practice (subject only to security screening and lawful limitations).
	•	Institutional rules must not make survival impossible in principle.
	•	Rules, pricing, job design, and vendor policies may not evolve to a point where a competent prisoner who is willing to work cannot, in principle, maintain access to essentials.

This formally encodes the “no state-created death-traps” condition that the discussion relied on.

6. Competence, capacity, mental health & custodial fallback duties

Type: new safeguard

Change Needed:
In the Rights / Health / Administration sections, introduce a formal capacity and mental-health framework:
	•	Competent vs incapacitated prisoners.
	•	Define criteria for when a prisoner is considered competent (capable of informed, voluntary decision-making) versus incapacitated (e.g. due to psychosis, severe depression, cognitive impairment, advanced dementia).
	•	Competent prisoners may refuse work or food even to the point of death; such outcomes are treated as self-authored choices within the social contract.
	•	Baseline custodial duties for incapacitated prisoners.
	•	Prisoners who lack decision-making capacity are placed under the same kind of protective and involuntary-treatment regimes that would apply to free citizens (e.g. mental health law, guardianship standards).
	•	For incapacitated prisoners, the state has a positive custodial duty to ensure they are fed and medically treated as needed until capacity is restored; “death by refusal” cannot be treated as self-authored where capacity is absent.
	•	Procedures and review.
	•	Require regular, documented capacity assessments for prisoners who show signs of severe mental illness or inability to manage their survival.
	•	Place this framework in Rights and Health/Administration, with cross-references to any Mental Health and Oversight provisions.

7. Market oversight, moral review & deaths-from-non-engagement review

Type: structural change / new safeguards

Change Needed:
In the Governance / Oversight / Accountability sections, add:
	•	Independent market oversight.
	•	Create an independent reviewing body (e.g. citizen jury–like panel or equivalent) with authority to:
	•	periodically review job types, wages, prices, and vendor arrangements;
	•	certify that they remain within the defined moral / “reasonable work” constraints;
	•	order corrections where arrangements have become exploitative, effectively coercive, or inconsistent with the “no-death-traps” axiom.
	•	Mandatory review of deaths linked to non-engagement.
	•	Require that any death or serious harm plausibly associated with non-engagement in the micro-economy (e.g. refusal to work or pay for essentials) triggers a formal review to determine:
	•	whether the prisoner was in fact competent at the time;
	•	whether at least one viable, moral survival path and charity channels were available;
	•	whether any architectural, policy, or market failure contributed.
	•	The reviewing body must be empowered to mandate remedial changes if failures are found.
