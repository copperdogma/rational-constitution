Essential Additions to the [Prison Proposal]
	1.	Label: Rights continuity and benefit inheritance
	•	Type: definitional fix
	•	Change Needed:
	•	Add an explicit clause that imprisonment derogates only freedom of movement (and any other rights expressly specified in the sentence); all other civil, political, and social rights remain in force, including eligibility for pensions, mandatory retirement, disability support, and healthcare. Place this in the Rights section and cross-reference Sentencing.
	•	Minimal Rationale (1–3 sentences):
	•	Without an explicit rights-continuity rule, it is unclear which rights survive imprisonment, creating hidden derogations (e.g. loss of retirement or disability protections) that contradict the “confinement-only” punishment principle and the claimed symmetry with free citizens.
	2.	Label: Moral micro-market specification
	•	Type: clarification
	•	Change Needed:
	•	Specify that the internal prison economy must (a) guarantee at least one available job that meets defined moral criteria (safe, rights-respecting, within typical abilities), preferably several; (b) pay at or above a benchmark comparable to outside minimum wage; (c) price essentials (food, water, shelter) so that a reasonable amount of work can cover them; and (d) forbid the state (or contractor) from extracting profit from prisoner labour beyond cost recovery. Place this in the Market section.
	•	Minimal Rationale (1–3 sentences):
	•	Without clear minimum standards for job availability, wages, prices, and state non-profit, the internal market can collapse into exploitative or de facto forced labour, undermining the claim that prisoners face the same value-for-essentials contract as free citizens.
	3.	Label: Internal and external alternatives to state employment
	•	Type: new safeguard
	•	Change Needed:
	•	Require that, subject to concrete safety constraints, prisoners may (a) create or join internal co-operatives and enterprises, (b) trade goods and services with each other under regulated but genuine market rules, and (c) receive funds or in-kind support from family, friends, and independent charities. Place this in the Market section with a cross-reference in the Rights section.
	•	Minimal Rationale (1–3 sentences):
	•	If the state is the only effective employer and provider, survival is functionally contingent on obedience to a single authority, creating structural coercion; internal and external alternatives are needed to keep participation in work and exchange genuinely voluntary.
	4.	Label: Capacity and mental-health threshold
	•	Type: new safeguard
	•	Change Needed:
	•	Introduce a formal capacity framework under which prisoners whose mental illness, cognitive impairment, or similar conditions substantially impair their ability to understand consequences or engage with the market are deemed not fully competent for survival decisions and must receive guaranteed essentials through a care regime rather than labour. Mandate periodic clinical assessment and review. Place this in the Rights and Health/Administration sections.
	•	Minimal Rationale (1–3 sentences):
	•	Treating non-work or refusal of food as a “voluntary choice” is only coherent for competent adults; without a capacity threshold and associated care obligation, the system misclassifies impaired prisoners, conflicting with its own autonomy-based moral axioms.
	5.	Label: Non-instrumental deprivation rule
	•	Type: constraint
	•	Change Needed:
	•	Add an explicit prohibition on using access to essentials, or the work opportunities required to pay for them, as a disciplinary or behavioural-control tool beyond what applies to free citizens; deprivation resulting from non-payment must not be manipulated to compel specific behaviours other than the general value-for-essentials contract. Place this in the Discipline/Administration section and cross-reference Market.
	•	Minimal Rationale (1–3 sentences):
	•	The model relies on deprivation being a neutral consequence of the same social contract that applies outside; if administrators can adjust access to work or essentials as punishment, the system reverts to coercive labour and contradicts its own non-slavery commitments.
	6.	Label: Safety vs. economic restriction separation
	•	Type: clarification
	•	Change Needed:
	•	Require that any limits on internal economic activity (e.g. farming, co-ops, trade, tools, materials) be justified solely on concrete safety and security grounds, documented as such, and never imposed to narrow survival options for economic, punitive, or convenience reasons. Place this in the Security/Administration section with references to the Market section.
	•	Minimal Rationale (1–3 sentences):
	•	To preserve the “confinement-only” structure, restrictions beyond movement must be narrowly tied to safety; otherwise, economic controls become covert extensions of punishment and undermine the voluntariness and legitimacy of the internal market.
