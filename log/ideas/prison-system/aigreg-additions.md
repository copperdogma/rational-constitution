Essential Additions to the [Prison Proposal]
	1.	Label: Precise meaning of “punishment = confinement only”
	•	Type: definitional fix
	•	Change Needed:
Add to the Principles/Rights section an explicit definition that:
	•	the only legally derogated right is freedom of movement;
	•	all other civil, social-program, and negative-rights norms remain as outside, subject only to standard security limits;
	•	harsher lived stakes inside (e.g., higher consequences of total refusal) are treated as consequences of confinement, not as additional formally imposed punishments.
	•	Minimal Rationale (1–3 sentences):
The current slogan can be read as “nothing changes except GPS coordinates,” which is false given the closed architecture. Making the legal/formal meaning explicit preserves logical consistency between the slogan and the actual structural effects of confinement.
	2.	Label: Closed-world architectural duties
	•	Type: clarification
	•	Change Needed:
In an Architecture / Governance section, explicitly list the state’s positive duties that arise because it controls a closed environment, including at minimum:
	•	maintaining a physically safe facility;
	•	providing at least one morally acceptable job that can earn enough for basic essentials;
	•	enforcing fair wages and non-exploitative prices;
	•	allowing vetted vendors, family support, and charity to operate;
	•	prohibiting artificial scarcity and profit extraction from prisoners.
	•	Minimal Rationale:
These duties were treated as background assumptions during the debate; without making them explicit, the non-exploitation claim and the “same contract” framing are under-specified and the system can slide into the very coercive patterns it intends to outlaw.
	3.	Label: Non-weaponization of deprivation
	•	Type: constraint
	•	Change Needed:
In the Market/Micro-economy section, add a clear rule that access to food, shelter, and other essentials (and the pricing of those goods) may not be manipulated to punish, coerce, or extract obedience beyond the base sentence of confinement. This includes bans on: punitive wage cuts, arbitrary price hikes for essentials, and using rationing as a behavioural lever.
	•	Minimal Rationale:
The model’s distinction between “self-authored deprivation” and state coercion only holds if deprivation is never used as an instrument of control. Explicitly banning deprivation-as-tool is necessary to keep the system aligned with its own anti-exploitation axiom.
	4.	Label: No-death-traps & viable survival paths
	•	Type: new safeguard
	•	Change Needed:
Add an axiom in the Rights / Architecture section requiring that:
	•	at all times there is at least one realistically viable, morally acceptable way for a competent prisoner to secure basic necessities via the micro-economy;
	•	voluntary charity and outside support remain permitted in practice (subject to security screening);
	•	institutional rules must not make survival impossible in principle for any competent inmate who minimally engages.
	•	Minimal Rationale:
The system’s claim that the state neither kills nor wrongfully lets prisoners die depends on survival being genuinely possible under non-rigged rules; this needs to be stated as an enforceable design constraint, not left implicit.
	5.	Label: Competence and mental-health handling
	•	Type: new safeguard
	•	Change Needed:
Add a Capacity & Mental Health subsection specifying that:
	•	prisoners who lack decision-making capacity (due to psychosis, severe depression, cognitive impairment, etc.) are treated under the same involuntary-treatment and protective regimes that apply outside;
	•	“death by refusal” is only treated as self-authored when a robust process has found the prisoner competent, informed, and free of overriding mental impairment.
	•	Minimal Rationale:
Without an explicit competence regime, the model risks classifying deaths of impaired prisoners as autonomous “refusals,” which violates its own autonomy/incapacity distinction and undermines the claim that only movement is intentionally punished.
	6.	Label: Review of deaths from non-engagement
	•	Type: new safeguard
	•	Change Needed:
In an Oversight / Accountability section, require that any death plausibly linked to non-engagement with the micro-economy (starvation, untreated illness where treatment was available, etc.) triggers a formal review to determine:
	•	whether the prisoner was in fact competent;
	•	whether at least one viable, moral survival path and charity channels were available;
	•	whether any architectural or policy failure contributed.
	•	Minimal Rationale:
This operationalizes the “no killing / no wrongful letting die / no exploitation” commitments and ensures the system does not, in practice, drift into deprivation-based punishment while still claiming to punish only by confinement.
	7.	Label: “Same social contract” phrasing
	•	Type: definitional fix
	•	Change Needed:
In the Introduction / Philosophical Rationale, refine the language so that “same social contract” is explicitly defined as:
	•	continuity of negative-rights norms (no claim-right to subsistence) and labour-for-necessities logic;
	•	not an assertion that the lived option topology inside is identical to outside.
Acknowledge that confinement legitimately raises the stakes of total refusal, even though the underlying norm is unchanged.
	•	Minimal Rationale:
The conversation showed that “same social contract” can be misread as claiming full phenomenological equivalence; tightening the phrasing avoids that over-claim while preserving the intended continuity of norms.
