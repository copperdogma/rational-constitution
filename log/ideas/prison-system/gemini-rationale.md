Reasoning Behind Essential Additions
	1.	Label: Rights Continuity & Imported Benefits
	•	Problem Exposed:
The conversation leaned heavily on “rights transparency” and the idea that prisoners remain full citizens except for mobility, but the original proposal did not fully spell out how other rights (retirement, disability, healthcare, pensions, etc.) automatically apply inside. This left open ambiguities about old, disabled, or otherwise supported prisoners that critics could treat as inconsistencies or gaps.
	•	Resolution:
By explicitly stating that prisoners retain all rights and social entitlements held by free citizens—minus movement and any rights explicitly removed by sentence—the system cleanly imports the entire outside rights framework into prison. Questions like “Does a 90-year-old have to work?” or “Does disability support apply?” are resolved automatically: whatever is true outside is true inside.
	•	Key Arguments / Tradeoffs:
	•	This formalizes what was already being assumed: that prison is just a change in geography, not a change in civic status.
	•	It avoids building a second, special-purpose rights regime for prisoners, which would undermine the elegance and simplicity of the model.
	•	The tradeoff is that the society’s broader rights and welfare architecture now directly determines prison conditions—if the outside system is harsh, prison will be harsh too; if it’s generous, prison will inherit that generosity.
	•	Status: resolved
	2.	Label: Competency & Mental Health Safeguard
	•	Problem Exposed:
Gemini (and earlier objections) raised the case of mentally ill, severely depressed, or otherwise incompetent prisoners who might be unable to work or to make rational survival decisions. Without a competency framework, the proposal risked either:
	•	looking like it would “let the mentally ill starve,” or
	•	forcing all prisoners to be treated paternalistically, undermining autonomy.
	•	Resolution:
Introducing an explicit competency standard—mirroring the one used outside—allows a clean split:
	•	Competent prisoners are treated as autonomous adults, free to make even self-destructive choices (e.g., hunger strike), just as free competent citizens can.
	•	Incompetent prisoners are treated under the same involuntary care/protection regimes as outside (e.g., psychiatric intervention, prevention of self-starvation).
This keeps the system aligned with existing medical-legal norms instead of inventing a new rule set.
	•	Key Arguments / Tradeoffs:
	•	This directly answers the “you’ll starve the crazy and call it dignity” critique by showing that mental incompetence is handled identically inside and out.
	•	It preserves the core moral axiom of adult autonomy where competence is intact.
	•	The tradeoff is that you inherit all the existing complexity and controversy around competency determinations—but that’s appropriate, since the system explicitly aims to mirror outside standards rather than reinvent them.
	•	Status: resolved
	3.	Label: Market Integrity & Access (Employer/Supplier of Last Resort)
	•	Problem Exposed:
Later in the conversation (especially in the “physics of access” critique), it became clear that even if rules permit a moral market, real-world frictions could prevent one from forming: outside vendors might refuse to deliver, employers might avoid prisoners, or logistics/security rules might choke off supply. In that scenario, the state would effectively become a monopoly again—not by design, but by necessity—breaking the “confined free market” structure and reintroducing coercive leverage.
	•	Resolution:
Requiring:
	•	at least one moral job per prisoner,
	•	guaranteed access to essentials at fair prices,
	•	open channels for external vendors and charity where feasible, and
	•	a formal obligation for the state to act as Employer/Supplier of Last Resort when the external market fails,
ensures that a functioning, moral micro-market actually exists in practice, not just on paper. The state steps in only to restore the conditions of a fair market, not to replace it with a monopolistic command system.
	•	Key Arguments / Tradeoffs:
	•	This directly addresses the concern that walls physically block the “exit option” and could unintentionally create a monopoly or market collapse.
	•	It keeps the system’s core moral claim intact: prisoners always have a genuine opportunity to provide value in exchange for essentials.
	•	The tradeoff is increased administrative complexity and cost to maintain market integrity; the state must monitor and sometimes actively support or simulate competition.
	•	Status: resolved
	4.	Label: Separation of Punishment from Economic Life
	•	Problem Exposed:
A recurring thread in the conversation was the risk that the proposal might slide, in implementation or perception, into “forced labour” or “work as punishment.” Critics repeatedly conflated “having to work to eat” with “being sentenced to work,” especially when the state controls the environment. Without a sharp, explicit statement separating confinement (the punishment) from economic participation (the ongoing social contract), the system could be misapplied or drift toward classic penal labour.
	•	Resolution:
By stating in the proposal that:
	•	the only core punishment is loss of movement (plus any specifically named rights), and
	•	economic obligations (work-for-essentials) are not part of the sentence but a continuation of the universal social contract,
you make it structurally impossible to sentence someone to “hard labour” as such. Courts can only change the box (where you are), not the rules of economic engagement inside that box.
	•	Key Arguments / Tradeoffs:
	•	This protects against regression to historical abuses (chain gangs, penal plantations, etc.).
	•	It anchors all labour questions in the same “value for essentials” logic that applies to free citizens, which was central to your original argument.
	•	The tradeoff is that some societies that want explicitly labour-based punishments cannot get them through this framework without breaking its core axiom.
	•	Status: resolved
	5.	Label: No Use of Essentials as Disciplinary Leverage
	•	Problem Exposed:
A subtle but crucial risk exposed in the debate was that, even if the macro-design is neutral, wardens or administrators could start using access to jobs, pricing of essentials, or eligibility for the internal market as informal punishment tools (e.g., “you broke a rule, so your food costs double,” or “you’re barred from all jobs for a month”). That would quietly reintroduce deprivation-as-punishment and collapse the distinction between “consequence of non-participation” and “engineered coercion.”
	•	Resolution:
Adding an explicit rule that disciplinary measures may not alter:
	•	access to essentials,
	•	baseline market participation,
	•	job availability (beyond what is strictly necessary for immediate safety/security),
and may not manipulate prices or wages as a sanction, keeps the work-for-essentials logic structurally neutral. Discipline must operate through other, clearly defined channels.
	•	Key Arguments / Tradeoffs:
	•	This preserves the core claim that the state is not using deprivation to “force” anything; it merely refuses to subsidize a non-working adult beyond whatever the general social system does.
	•	It protects against local abuse without needing to micromanage every disciplinary decision.
	•	The tradeoff is a constraint on the warden’s toolset; administrators lose an easy (but abusive) lever and must rely on other, more carefully justified forms of discipline.
	•	Status: resolved
