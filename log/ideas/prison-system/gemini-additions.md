Essential Additions to the [Prison Proposal]
	1.	Label: Rights Continuity & Imported Benefits
	•	Type: definitional fix
	•	Change Needed:
	•	In the Rights section, explicitly state that prisoners retain all rights and social entitlements held by free citizens except:
	1.	freedom of movement, and
	2.	any additional rights explicitly removed by their sentence.
	•	Explicitly mention that this includes things like pensions, mandatory retirement, disability support, healthcare, and any other general social benefits.
	•	Minimal Rationale (1–3 sentences):
Rights “transparency” was central to the conversation but not fully formalized. Making this continuity explicit avoids hidden exceptions, auto-resolves edge cases (old/disabled prisoners), and anchors the whole system in one clear axiom: imprisonment changes geography, not civic status.
	2.	Label: Competency & Mental Health Safeguard
	•	Type: new safeguard
	•	Change Needed:
	•	In the Rights / Health section, add an explicit competency standard:
	•	Competent prisoners retain full autonomy over choices that may lead to self-harm (including refusing to work or eat), exactly as free competent adults do.
	•	Incompetent prisoners (e.g., severe mental illness) are treated under the same involuntary care and protection standards that apply outside prison, including prevention of self-starvation where legally required.
	•	Minimal Rationale (1–3 sentences):
The conversation showed that without a formal competency distinction, the system could appear to “let the mentally ill starve” or, conversely, to override all prisoner agency. Aligning with the outside-world competency standard preserves autonomy where appropriate while preventing obvious abuse of the most vulnerable.
	3.	Label: Market Integrity & Access (Employer/Supplier of Last Resort)
	•	Type: constraint
	•	Change Needed:
	•	In the Market section, explicitly require that:
	•	There is always at least one “moral job” available to each prisoner (within their abilities, non-rights-violating, and paying at least a socially defined fair/minimum wage).
	•	Essentials (food, water, basic shelter, basic clothing) are always obtainable at fair prices.
	•	Outside vendors, charities, and family support may freely participate unless there is a concrete, narrowly tailored security reason.
	•	If external supply or employment fails in practice, the state must act as Employer and Supplier of Last Resort under the same “moral market” constraints (fair wages, fair prices, no exploitative profit).
	•	Minimal Rationale (1–3 sentences):
Because walls can block real-world access even when rules permit it, the conversation showed that the system needs a hard guarantee that a functioning, moral micro-market actually exists. Without this, prisoners could be trapped in a de facto monopoly or non-functioning market, breaking the core symmetry with free citizens.
	4.	Label: Separation of Punishment from Economic Life
	•	Type: definitional fix
	•	Change Needed:
	•	In the Sentencing / Punishment section, explicitly state that:
	•	The only core punishment for imprisonment is loss of freedom of movement (plus any other rights specifically named in the sentence).
	•	The requirement to provide value in order to obtain essentials is not a punishment; it is continuation of the general social contract that applies to all citizens.
	•	Courts may not sentence “forced labour” as such; they only sentence confinement (and any explicitly listed rights removals), within which the ordinary market logic operates.
	•	Minimal Rationale (1–3 sentences):
The conversation repeatedly relied on this distinction to rebut “slavery” and “forced labour” objections. Making it explicit prevents later drift toward sentencing people to labour rather than to confinement, which would structurally undermine the whole framework.
	5.	Label: No Use of Essentials as Disciplinary Leverage
	•	Type: new safeguard
	•	Change Needed:
	•	In the Discipline / Administration section, add an explicit prohibition:
	•	Access to essentials (or their prices), job availability, or baseline market participation may not be modified as a disciplinary measure for rule-breaking.
	•	Discipline must use other tools (loss of non-essential privileges, segregation, etc.), but the “work-for-essentials” structure remains neutral and unaffected by behaviour.
	•	Minimal Rationale (1–3 sentences):
To keep starvation or deprivation from becoming a de facto punishment or compliance tool, the market for essentials must remain structurally independent of disciplinary decisions. This preserves the key claim that the state is not “using deprivation instrumentally,” but simply maintaining the same value-for-essentials contract as outside.
