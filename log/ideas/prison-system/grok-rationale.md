Reasoning Behind Essential Additions

⸻

	1.	Label: Rights Continuity & Explicit Derogations
	•	Problem Exposed:
The conversation repeatedly relied on the idea that prisoners are “citizens in a smaller box,” but the proposal did not fully codify this as a hard rule. Without an explicit “all rights retained except movement and listed derogations” clause, prisons could accumulate implicit restrictions and still claim to be within the model, undermining the rights-symmetry argument used to rebut slavery/coercion objections.
	•	Resolution:
The addition makes rights continuity explicit and requires that any loss of rights beyond movement be either:
	•	part of general law that applies to all citizens in certain conditions, or
	•	directly and clearly listed in the sentence or relevant statute.
This preserves the core premise: prison is not a moral exception zone but an application of the same rights framework under geographic constraint.
	•	Key Arguments / Tradeoffs:
	•	It answers critiques that “prisoners will inevitably lose more rights in practice” by forcing every extra loss into the open as a derogation.
	•	It supports future layering (e.g., mandatory rehab, special communication limits) while keeping them clearly visible and contestable.
	•	The tradeoff is reduced “administrative flexibility” in exchange for a stricter, more honest rights ledger.
	•	Status: resolved

⸻

	2.	Label: Internal Moral Market Constraints
	•	Problem Exposed:
Objections from multiple angles turned on the risk that, without precise constraints, the “work for essentials” rule collapses into:
	•	forced labour in practice (if wages are too low or jobs are abusive),
	•	structural starvation (if full-time labour still cannot buy basics), or
	•	state-profit slavery (if the state or contractors skim surplus value).
All of those would directly contradict the claim that this is not slavery and that the social contract is mirrored, not exploited.
	•	Resolution:
The added constraints define what makes the internal market “moral” and structurally non-coercive:
	•	no net profit extraction by the state,
	•	at least one morally acceptable job per work-capable prisoner,
	•	a reasonableness standard for job nature, and
	•	pay/price calibration such that diligent work can reliably purchase essentials.
This locks in the conditions under which “provide value or go without” is genuinely equivalent to the external social contract.
	•	Key Arguments / Tradeoffs:
	•	It directly answers the slavery/monopoly/underpayment concerns without abandoning the work-for-essentials structure.
	•	It ensures that refusal to work leading to deprivation is a genuine self-directed choice, not a disguised inevitability.
	•	The tradeoff is that someone (see Item 7) must be responsible for guarding these constraints in practice.
	•	Status: resolved

⸻

	3.	Label: External Resources & Third-Party Support
	•	Problem Exposed:
During the debate, a key move that made the model more libertarian and less paternalistic was allowing anyone (including the prisoner’s past self via savings) to pay the bills. Without this explicitly written, the system risks being misimplemented as “no one may pay except via prison labour,” which would:
	•	transform the structure into a work mandate, and
	•	undermine the argument that the prisoner remains free to choose non-participation at the cost of deprivation.
	•	Resolution:
By explicitly recognising savings, lawful outside income, and voluntary third-party contributions as legitimate ways to meet costs, the system maintains that:
	•	work is an available mechanism, not a compulsory condition, and
	•	prosperous or supported prisoners can simply pay, just as free citizens can.
This preserves the high-agency nature of the proposal and avoids turning its market into a disguised labour conscription scheme.
	•	Key Arguments / Tradeoffs:
	•	This was crucial in defending the model against the “you are forcing them to obey the state or die” line — they are simply subject to the same economic logic as free citizens; others can help them.
	•	It also clarifies that the system is not jealous about the source of value, only that someone covers the cost of essentials.
	•	The tradeoff is an explicit class asymmetry in experience (rich prisoners have an easier time), but the conversation accepted that as consistent with the external social contract.
	•	Status: resolved

	4.	Label: Retirement, Disability & Social Program Continuity
	•	Problem Exposed:
Multiple edge cases (elderly prisoners, disabled prisoners, societies with pensions/UBI/disability schemes) exposed an implicit assumption: that prison does not nullify outside social entitlements. Without an explicit statement, an implementation might:
	•	compel a 90-year-old to work to eat, despite a mandatory retirement regime outside, or
	•	deny disability benefits inside, forcing structurally unfit prisoners into an impossible “work or starve” choice.
	•	Resolution:
The addition binds all general social programs to prisoners exactly as they bind to free citizens. In particular:
	•	if a citizen outside would be considered retired and no longer expected to work for essentials, the same applies inside;
	•	if a citizen would receive disability support instead of being forced into the labour market, the same applies inside.
This keeps rights continuity from collapsing exactly where it matters most (vulnerability, old age, incapacity).
	•	Key Arguments / Tradeoffs:
	•	It substantially strengthens the fairness and moral plausibility of the system for vulnerable groups without changing the core social-contract continuity.
	•	It also elegantly solves the “90-year-old prisoner” problem without bespoke prison rules.
	•	The tradeoff is that prison administrators cannot treat all prisoners as equally expected to work — they must honour the same exemptions society uses outside.
	•	Status: resolved

	5.	Label: Competence, Incapacity & Baseline Custodial Duties
	•	Problem Exposed:
A central hinge in the debate was the distinction between:
	•	a competent prisoner who chooses not to work or eat, and
	•	someone who is incapacitated (medical or psychiatric) and effectively unable to exercise meaningful choice.
Without writing that distinction into the proposal, the system risks treating structurally caused deaths (e.g., psychotic prisoners unable to engage) as if they were free, informed refusals, which contradicts its own claim that only self-directed lethal choices are permitted.
	•	Resolution:
The change defines:
	•	competence as a prerequisite for treating deprivation as self-chosen, and
	•	a special duty of care for incapacitated individuals, drawn from the same general custodial/health obligations the state has in any setting of confinement.
It allows the system to maintain “no forced saving of competent adults” while still refusing to abandon those who literally cannot decide or act.
	•	Key Arguments / Tradeoffs:
	•	This was crucial in blocking the “you’re letting psychotic people starve to death and calling it agency” objection.
	•	It keeps the moral hinge clean: lethal outcomes are permissible only where the prisoner had genuine capacity to accept that cost.
	•	The tradeoff is the need for some evaluative machinery (medical/psychiatric assessment), but that aligns with standard custody practice and doesn’t alter the economic structure.
	•	Status: resolved

⸻

	6.	Label: Non-Instrumental Deprivation Rule
	•	Problem Exposed:
Critics repeatedly worried that, even if the formal design said “the state does not order you to work,” in practice administrators could:
	•	withhold food that had been paid for,
	•	block access to the market, or
	•	quietly use price manipulation
to force compliance, turning deprivation into an instrument of punishment or control. That would directly contradict the defended claim that deprivation is never a disciplinary tool in this model.
	•	Resolution:
The explicit rule forbidding deprivation of paid-for essentials or manipulation of access/prices as a disciplinary mechanism closes this loophole. It reserves deprivation to cases where the prisoner:
	•	has real access to moral work or other funding routes, and
	•	voluntarily declines to use them.
Any other disciplinary response must be drawn from separately authorised, clearly enumerated sanctions.
	•	Key Arguments / Tradeoffs:
	•	This preserves the conceptual distinction between “you die because you refused to participate in a fair system” and “the state is starving you to break your will.”
	•	It also pre-empts a common bureaucratic failure mode: turning control over essentials into a blunt behavioural tool.
	•	The tradeoff is some loss of “easy leverage” for administrators, but that loss was implicitly accepted by the model’s anti-coercive commitments.
	•	Status: resolved

⸻

	7.	Label: Market Oversight & Moral Review
	•	Problem Exposed:
Several critiques pointed out that a small, state-designed market is structurally vulnerable to:
	•	vendor capture,
	•	quiet underpayment,
	•	uncompetitive contracts, and
	•	slow drift away from the intended moral standards.
Without some external check, the “moral micro-market” could, over time, become exploitative in practice while still paying lip service to the proposal’s language.
	•	Resolution:
Introducing an independent review body with defined powers to:
	•	audit wages, prices, and job types,
	•	check them against the stated moral/“reasonable work” criteria, and
	•	mandate adjustments where needed
provides a minimal structural guarantee that the implemented system remains aligned with the designed system. It does this without changing the core architecture of “restricted but fair market inside.”
	•	Key Arguments / Tradeoffs:
	•	This was the main answer to “but in the real world, contractors and administrators will game this.”
	•	It acknowledges that, given monopoly-like conditions, governance and oversight are necessary to uphold the model’s own constraints.
	•	The tradeoff is an added governance layer, but one that is conceptually light and entirely in service of the stated axioms.
	•	Status: resolved
