Essential Additions to the [Prison Proposal]

⸻

	1.	Label: Rights Continuity & Explicit Derogations
	•	Type: clarification
	•	Change Needed:
	•	Add to the Rights section that prisoners retain all rights held by free citizens except:
	1.	freedom of movement, and
	2.	any additional rights explicitly derogated by their sentence or by general law that applies to all citizens in defined circumstances.
	•	State that no other rights are lost implicitly “by virtue of imprisonment.”
	•	Minimal Rationale (1–3 sentences):
This makes explicit the core axiom that prison only constrains geography plus enumerated derogations. It prevents hidden or ad-hoc right losses and keeps the system aligned with its own transparency and symmetry commitments.

⸻

	2.	Label: Internal Moral Market Constraints
	•	Type: constraint
	•	Change Needed:
	•	In the Market/Economy section, specify that:
	•	the state (and its contractors) may not extract net profit from prisoner labour;
	•	every job offered must meet a “moral/reasonable work” standard (no rights violations, no degradation, something a free citizen could reasonably choose);
	•	at least one such job must be available to each work-capable prisoner;
	•	wages and prices must be set so that a reasonably diligent worker can reliably afford basic essentials (food, water, lodging) from that work alone.
	•	Minimal Rationale (1–3 sentences):
These constraints block the system from drifting into de facto slavery, exploitative wages, or starvation through underpayment. They are needed to keep the internal market genuinely analogous to the external one and to ensure “work for essentials” remains fair, not structurally coercive.

⸻

	3.	Label: External Resources & Third-Party Support
	•	Type: clarification
	•	Change Needed:
	•	In the Market/Finance section, explicitly allow prisoners to meet their costs (food, lodging, etc.) using:
	•	pre-existing savings,
	•	any lawful ongoing outside income, and
	•	voluntary payments from family, friends, charities, or other third parties,
without any penalty for choosing not to work when their obligations are covered.
	•	Minimal Rationale (1–3 sentences):
This makes clear that labour is not a mandated condition of survival, only one available route to value. It preserves high-agency choice and avoids turning the system into an automatic labour mandate while keeping the social-contract symmetry intact.

⸻

	4.	Label: Retirement, Disability & Social Program Continuity
	•	Type: clarification
	•	Change Needed:
	•	In the Rights/Social Programs section, state that all general social entitlements (e.g., pensions, mandatory retirement, disability benefits, UBI, healthcare schemes) apply identically to prisoners.
	•	Clarify that where a free citizen would no longer be required to work to secure essentials (e.g., mandatory retirement age, qualifying disability), an imprisoned citizen is under the same rule.
	•	Minimal Rationale (1–3 sentences):
This locks in rights transparency across life stages and conditions and prevents edge cases like elderly or disabled prisoners being structurally forced to work when they would not be outside. It keeps the prison system from silently overriding society’s own safety-net and retirement logic.

⸻

	5.	Label: Competence, Incapacity & Baseline Custodial Duties
	•	Type: new safeguard
	•	Change Needed:
	•	In the Rights/Custody section, introduce:
	•	a distinction between competent prisoners (capable of informed refusal of work/food) and those who are medically or psychiatrically incapacitated;
	•	a rule that competent prisoners may refuse work or food even to the point of death;
	•	a rule that incapacitated prisoners fall under general custody/health obligations, including a duty to preserve life through emergency care (and feeding where necessary) until capacity is restored.
	•	Minimal Rationale (1–3 sentences):
The model’s defence of starvation as self-directed requires genuine agency. Without an incapacity carve-out, the system could allow structurally caused deaths of people who lack meaningful choice, contradicting its own distinction between self-directed refusal and structural lethal coercion.

⸻

	6.	Label: Non-Instrumental Deprivation Rule
	•	Type: constraint
	•	Change Needed:
	•	In the Discipline/Administration section, explicitly forbid:
	•	withdrawing paid-for essentials (food, lodging, water),
	•	blocking access to the internal market, or
	•	manipulating prices of essentials
as tools of discipline, coercion, or behavioural control. Any disciplinary measures must use separately authorised sanctions, not deprivation of essentials or access to the market.
	•	Minimal Rationale (1–3 sentences):
This is required to maintain the claim that deprivation is not wielded as an instrument of punishment or compulsion. It keeps the distinction clean between “you lack essentials because you chose not to obtain them” and “the state is actively using deprivation as leverage.”

⸻

	7.	Label: Market Oversight & Moral Review
	•	Type: structural change
	•	Change Needed:
	•	In the Governance/Oversight section, add a requirement for an independent reviewing body (e.g., citizen jury–like panel or equivalent) to:
	•	periodically review job types, wages, prices, and vendor arrangements;
	•	certify that they remain within the defined moral/“reasonable work” constraints;
	•	order corrections where arrangements become exploitative or effectively coercive.
	•	Minimal Rationale (1–3 sentences):
Because the internal market is small and state-designed, it is unusually vulnerable to drift, capture, or quiet exploitation. A minimal but independent review mechanism is necessary to keep the implemented system aligned with its declared axioms over time.
