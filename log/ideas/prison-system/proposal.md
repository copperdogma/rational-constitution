A Consistent and Moral Framework for Prison Systems
---------------------------------------------------

Core Idea

Imprisonment should remove only one right:
freedom of movement.

All other rights, responsibilities, and social-contract obligations remain exactly the same as for any free citizen.

This yields a prison system that is non-exploitative, morally consistent, transparent, and incentive-aligned, while avoiding the contradictions and double standards of traditional incarceration.

⸻

1. Rights Continuity

Under this model, a prisoner retains every right a free citizen has, except movement, unless explicitly removed by their sentence.

This means they still have:
•	the right to work
•	the right to earn wages
•	the right to spend those wages
•	the right to pensions, retirement, disability support, healthcare, etc.
•	the right to choose how to allocate their resources
•	the right to refuse work
•	the right to refuse food
•	the right to make self-directed choices

Prison is not a separate moral universe.
It’s the same society — just inside walls.

This eliminates arbitrary abuses, hidden coercion, and the ethical fog that surrounds modern prisons.

⸻

1. The Moral Micro-Market

Inside the prison, the state establishes a restricted but fully moral free market:
•	at least one job opportunity that meets moral standards
•	often several options
•	fair wages
•	fair prices
•	no profit extraction from the prisoner
•	outside charity or personal savings allowed
•	no forced labour
•	no state commands—just voluntary exchange
•	third-party vendors allowed if desired

This replicates the same social contract that exists outside:

Provide value → obtain essentials.

Nothing more, nothing less.

If a prisoner chooses not to work or not to buy food, that is treated the same as any free citizen making the same decision: a self-directed choice, not a state-imposed harm.

⸻

1. Starvation, coercion, and responsibility

In this system:
•	starvation is never used as discipline
•	the state never orders the prisoner to do anything
•	the state provides moral opportunities to survive
•	the prisoner retains agency over whether to use them

Therefore:

If a prisoner starves by refusing available moral options,
it is a self-directed choice, not structural coercion.

This is identical to the free world.

The state’s responsibility is to create a fair system, not to override agency.

⸻

1. Elegance Through Symmetry

Because the prison mirrors the outside world’s economic logic, many problems disappear automatically:

No “free room and board” double standard.

Prisoners pay for what they consume, as citizens do.

No incentive to reoffend for guaranteed housing/food.

Because nothing is guaranteed except fair opportunity.

No moral confusion over forced labour.

There is none — only voluntary exchange.

No need for special prison rules for old or disabled prisoners.

They simply inherit society’s rules:
•	retirement = no need to work
•	disability support = applies automatically

If essentials become free in society, they become free in prison.

The model adapts automatically to post-labour or post-scarcity worlds.

⸻

1. The Only Punishment Is Confinement

Everything else remains ordinary citizenship.

This makes the system:
•	transparent
•	humane
•	predictable
•	incentive-clean
•	corruption-resistant
•	rights-coherent
•	morally consistent with liberal, libertarian, and welfare-capitalist principles alike

The state doesn’t gain new powers.
It simply restricts geography for a set period.

All other rules remain those of the broader society.

⸻

1. Why This Is Morally Coherent

Because it preserves agency, responsibility, and fairness:
•	Prisoners are treated as full adults with full autonomy.
•	The state does not coerce them beyond restricting movement.
•	The social contract is the same inside and outside.
•	Death by refusal is self-directed, not engineered.
•	Morality of exchange is enforced.
•	No exploitation is possible under the constraints.
•	Rights flow in a single coherent system rather than two conflicting ones.
•	Changing economic conditions naturally propagate inside prison.

It is the first system where imprisonment is:

Punishment by confinement only —
with complete continuity of rights, obligations, and economic agency.

⸻

1. Why It’s Elegant

Because it eliminates entire categories of messy questions:
•	“Should prisoners get food for free?” → Same as everyone else.
•	“Should old prisoners work?” → Same rules as outside.
•	“Is labour coercive?” → No more than outside.
•	“Does the state owe them housing?” → Same as outside.
•	“Can prisoners save money?” → Yes.
•	“Can people support prisoners financially?” → Yes.
•	“What if AI makes essentials free?” → Then free for all, inside and out.

There is no second-class moral logic.
No special exceptions.
No confusing patchwork of rules.

Just geographic confinement, and otherwise full citizenship.

⸻

Bottom Line

This model:
•	preserves dignity
•	preserves agency
•	preserves rights
•	eliminates exploitative incentives
•	equalizes moral obligations inside and outside prison
•	scales into future economic conditions
•	and simplifies the justice system dramatically

It is logically coherent, morally clean, and systemically elegant.

And most importantly:

It is the only prison system whose internal ethics match the ethics of the society that created it — exactly, and without contradiction.
