# Integrated Additions (Corrections Layer)

These additions govern the *implementation of confinement*, *economic architecture*, *operations*, and **day-to-day rules** that must comply with the justice framework.

---

## 1. Rights continuity — Corrections Implementation
**Type:** implementation clarification

### Corrections-Level Additions
- Ensure uninterrupted access to:
  - work opportunities,
  - wages,
  - spending ability,
  - pensions, retirement, disability, healthcare,
  - communication channels except where explicitly restricted by sentencing.
- Clarify that corrections may not create implicit derogations via operations.

## 2. Closed-world moral micro-market & architectural duties
**Type:** clarification / constraint

### Corrections-Level Additions
- Maintain a physically safe, non-degrading environment.
- Provide **at least one moral, reasonable job** for every work-capable prisoner:
  - not degrading,
  - not rights-violating,
  - similar to jobs a free citizen might reasonably accept.
- Wages and prices must allow a reasonably diligent worker to obtain essentials:
  - food,
  - water,
  - basic shelter,
  - basic clothing.
- No extraction of net profit from prisoner labour beyond genuine cost recovery.
- Market integrity:
  - no artificial scarcity,
  - no manipulation of prices or availability,
  - no hidden economic leverage.
- State as supplier/employer of last resort if external vendors fail.
- Security is the only legitimate grounds for restricting economic activity.

## 3. External resources & alternatives to state employment
**Type:** clarification / safeguard

### Corrections-Level Additions
- Prisoners may pay for essentials using:
  - pre-existing savings,
  - lawful outside income,
  - family/friend/charity support.
- No penalty for not working if obligations are met through lawful external resources.
- Allow (with safety screening):
  - non-state employers,
  - vetted private firms, co-ops, NGOs,
  - internal non-state enterprises.
- Avoid hegemonic state-employer monopoly where safe alternatives exist.

---

## 4. Non-weaponization of essentials & non-instrumental deprivation
**Type:** constraint

### Corrections-Level Additions
- Essentials may not be used as punishment:
  - no price manipulation,
  - no rationing-as-discipline,
  - no scarcity engineering.
- Discipline applies only to **non-essential privileges** or safety-driven segregation.
- The essentials market must remain neutral, non-punitive, and stable.

---

## 5. No death-traps & guaranteed viable survival paths — Corrections Component
**Type:** safeguard

### Corrections-Level Additions
- Always maintain:
  - at least one viable, moral job allowing survival,
  - functioning charity channels,
  - fair wages/prices.
- Rules may not evolve such that survival becomes impossible through:
  - pricing,
  - job design,
  - administrative decisions,
  - vendor failure without fallback.

---

## 6. Competence, capacity, mental health — Corrections Implementation
**Type:** safeguard

### Corrections-Level Additions
- Operationalize capacity assessments.
- Coordinate with health/mental-health professionals.
- Implement custodial duties for incapacitated prisoners (feeding, medical care).
- Document and regularly review capacity in cases of self-endangerment.

---

## 7. Market oversight, moral review & deaths-from-non-engagement review — Corrections Implementation
**Type:** oversight mechanism

### Corrections-Level Additions
- Provide operational access and data to the independent oversight body.
- Implement corrective actions mandated by reviewers.
- Maintain transparent records of:
  - job availability,
  - wages,
  - pricing,
  - vendor arrangements,
  - capacity evaluations,
  - circumstances of deaths or serious harms tied to non-engagement.

---

## 8. Optional Module: State-Only Employment (SOE) for Integrity and Fairness
**Type:** optional implementation module

### Corrections-Level Additions
- A corrections system **may** choose to restrict internal employment to state‑provided jobs only, subject to:

1. **Minimum Requirement**
   - The state must provide at least one moral job type paid at genuine market rate.

2. **Integrity Protection**
   - Restricting employment to the state eliminates the possibility of:
     - sham contracts with a prisoner’s former employer,
     - criminal networks paying disguised “wages,”
     - wealthy prisoners purchasing a privileged internal lifestyle through external income,
     - outside organizations manipulating the internal economy through preferential hiring.

3. **Fairness Guarantee**
   - Internal inequality arises solely from actual productive skill, not external wealth or connections.  
   - Higher‑value skills earn higher wages, but:
     - this mirrors real market value,
     - reflects genuine contributions, and
     - remains open to all prisoners through upskilling.

4. **Compatibility**
   - This module is optional and can be combined with:
     - open vendor markets or internal‑only markets, and
     - the one‑way money permeability rule,  
     - the minimum moral economy core,  
     - and rehabilitation‑centric designs.
