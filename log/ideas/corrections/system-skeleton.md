# Corrections System — Confinement Implementation & Micro-Market

## 1. Purpose of Corrections
Imprisonment derogates freedom of movement.  
Once movement is restricted, prisoners can no longer secure work, food, housing, or safety in the ways free citizens can, creating a structural dependency caused by the state.

The purpose of the corrections system is to create the **minimal moral environment** necessary for a confined person to:
- survive,
- exercise meaningful agency, and
- continue to enjoy all non‑derogated rights,
without softening or intensifying the punishment itself.

Concretely, corrections must:
- provide a moral pathway to acquire essentials,
- supply security and basic infrastructure that confinement makes impossible to self‑provide, and
- reconstruct a bounded micro‑economy that mirrors the external “provide value → obtain necessities” social contract.

Implement confinement in a way that:
- respects justice-level constraints (movement-only punishment plus explicit derogations)
- preserves all non-derogated rights
- maintains agency and autonomy
- avoids coercion beyond confinement
- mirrors the economic logic of free society

Corrections **implements**, rather than redefines, the justice framework;  
the punishment remains confinement, not deprivation or forced labour.

### Scope and Limits of Corrections Authority

The corrections system may only exercise powers that:
- are explicitly defined in general law as part of the standard imprisonment derogation package, or
- are explicitly added by the sentencing court for a specific case.

Operational convenience, cost, or tradition do not by themselves authorise additional restrictions.  
Every form of search, surveillance, monitoring, or restriction must correspond to a recognised derogation in that legal package.

### Activation of Punishment Conditions

Punitive rights‑derogations associated with imprisonment apply only once a prisoner is housed in a facility capable of providing the corresponding moral infrastructure (including the prison micro‑economy).

Detention prior to or during transfer (jails, holding cells, transport sites) is a non‑punitive enforcement measure.  
In those contexts:
- no labour‑for‑necessities regime may be imposed, and
- the state must provide essentials as part of its custodial safety duty.

Once transferred to a facility that can implement the micro‑economy, the value‑for‑necessities structure becomes active immediately, subject to all moral safeguards.

## 2. Rights Continuity in Practice
Because only movement is removed:
- prisoners may work
- prisoners may earn wages
- prisoners may spend wages
- prisoners may receive outside support (savings, income, charity)
- prisoners may refuse work or food
- ordinary civil rights continue to apply unless expressly derogated

Corrections must not remove additional rights “by virtue of imprisonment” as an implicit side‑effect.  
Any operational limits must be justified by concrete, reviewable security needs, not by revenue, convenience, or control.

### Known Rules and Self-Authored Outcomes

Confinement and the internal market structure arise from general, publicly knowable rules under which all citizens live, including:
- the legal conditions for punishment, and
- the predefined structure of confinement when movement‑derogation is imposed.

When a person commits a crime and is lawfully sentenced, they enter a confinement environment whose architecture and consequences were set in advance.
Inside that environment:
- the state provides the minimal moral conditions for survival, and
- the prisoner retains full agency over whether to use them.

Refusal to engage a viable survival path is therefore treated in the same way as outside:  
a self‑directed choice, not a state‑authored harm.

## 3. The Moral Micro-Market
A restricted but moral free market must exist inside confinement.

The internal prison economy is **not** intended to be a full free market.  
It reproduces only the moral logic of the external labour‑for‑essentials social contract under confined conditions.

Requirements:
- at least one job meeting moral standards is guaranteed for every work‑capable prisoner
- ideally multiple job types exist to maintain agency and fit capacities
- fair wages (non-exploitative) allow a reasonably diligent worker to cover basic essentials
- fair prices (non-exploitative) for food, water, basic shelter, and basic clothing
- no net profit extraction from prisoner labour beyond genuine cost recovery for running the facility and micro‑economy
- optional third-party vendors and employers are allowed, subject to safety constraints
- charity and savings are permitted as funding sources
- no forced labour, no state commands to work

The market must structurally resemble society’s “provide value → obtain essentials” logic while respecting confinement and security.

Artificial scarcity, arbitrary caps, or manipulation of the internal economy to increase dependence or leverage over prisoners are explicitly forbidden.

### Minimum Labour Architecture (Single-Path Requirement)

At minimum, a corrections system must provide:
- one (1) reliably available, moral job that:
  - does not violate any protected rights,
  - is work that a reasonable free citizen could accept,
  - pays a fair, non‑exploitative wage, and
  - allows a diligent worker to secure all basic essentials (food, water, basic shelter, basic clothing).

No additional job types, internal competition, or external free‑market access are morally required by this framework.  
Societies may choose to offer:
- multiple job options,
- access to private vendors or employers, or
- open‑to‑the‑world market participation,

but these are optional policy choices, not moral prerequisites.

The single guaranteed path must be:
- stable,
- consistently available, and
- immune to manipulation for discipline or leverage.

#### Moral Sufficiency of a Single Option

The ethical requirement under confinement is **not** the size of the option set but that at least one job is humane, safe, fairly compensated, and genuinely viable for any work‑capable prisoner.  
Providing additional options is permitted and may be desirable, but reduced choice does not by itself create new coercion beyond the punishment of confinement so long as the available path meets these standards.

### Administrative Reality of the Micro-Market

The internal prison economy is, by design, far smaller and simpler than the free market:
- fewer vendors and job types,
- a single legal and physical jurisdiction,
- complete transparency over prices, wages, and transactions.

Because of this confined scale, the state can:
- enforce tighter moral constraints on job quality, pricing, and wages than in the general economy,
- apply stronger minimum standards to compensate for reduced choice,
- and maintain effective oversight without disproportionate regulatory burden.

Regulatory difficulty is therefore not a weakness of the micro‑market but a feature: its limited scope makes robust moral regulation more, not less, achievable.

### Rehabilitation Through Market-Equivalent Work

This model does not impose rehabilitation as a mandatory objective, but rehabilitation effects arise naturally from the work rules.

Because all available jobs must:
- be moral (non‑degrading, non‑rights‑violating),
- be reasonable work comparable to free‑citizen occupations, and
- pay market‑rate wages,

they are, by definition, jobs with real value in the external economy.

Any prisoner who works is therefore acquiring marketable, transferable skills without needing a separate rehabilitation programme.  
Rehabilitation becomes emergent rather than imposed, incentive‑aligned rather than paternalistic, and continuous with the external economy rather than artificial or isolated.

## 4. Wage & Price Calibration
Economic rules must:
- prevent exploitation
- avoid coercion packaged as “market outcomes”
- maintain feasibility for prisoners to obtain essentials
- avoid state profit incentives
- adjust with external economic changes

If essentials become free in society, they become free in prison.

Calibration must ensure that, in practice, a competent, willing prisoner can maintain access to essentials through:
- at least one viable, moral job, and/or
- fair access to lawful outside resources and charity.

---

## 5. Anti-Monopoly & Anti-Coercion Rules
The state and its contractors must not:
- use deprivation of essentials as discipline  
- coerce labour by creating artificially limited options  
- manipulate wages/prices to force work  
- design the market to engineer behaviours or increase dependence  

Monopolistic abuse is prohibited.  
Where monopoly is structurally unavoidable (e.g., the state as default provider), strict fairness constraints apply:
- wages and prices must remain within defined moral bounds
- opportunities to work must not be withheld to influence behaviour

---

## 6. Starvation, Responsibility, and Agency
Inside this system:
- starvation is never a disciplinary tool
- the state provides moral opportunities to survive
- the state issues no labour commands
- refusal to work or eat remains, for competent prisoners, a self-directed choice
- outcomes mirror the free world’s social contract rather than adding a new punitive layer

The state’s duty is to maintain a fair structure and viable survival paths, not to override agency.

Any death or serious harm plausibly associated with non‑engagement in the micro‑economy must trigger independent review (see Oversight).

---

## 7. Supply-of-Last-Resort Clause
If all external vendors or employers fail or withdraw:
- the state (or its contractor) must act as employer and supplier of last resort
- essentials must be supplied at fair prices  
- without profit  
- under the same wage/price rules as external vendors

This prevents structural deprivation and ensures no state-created death‑traps.

---

## 8. Charity and Outside Funds
Corrections must permit prisoners to meet their costs via:
- external financial support
- prisoner savings
- lawful ongoing outside income
- family, friends, or charity paying for essentials

There is no penalty for a prisoner who chooses not to work when their obligations are covered by lawful outside resources.

This mirrors free-world economic freedom while respecting security screening and contraband rules.

---

## 9. Incapacity Framework
For prisoners unable to work or manage their survival:
- retirement rules apply automatically where pension conditions are met  
- disability rules apply automatically where disability conditions are met  
- medical incapacity is treated identically to the free world  

Corrections does not invent special exceptions; it inherits them from general law.

Operationally, the system must:
- co‑ordinate with health and mental‑health services for capacity assessments
- implement custodial duties (feeding, treatment, safe housing) for incapacitated prisoners consistent with justice‑level requirements.

---

## 10. Oversight & Inspections
A corrections system must support:
- economic audits  
- job-condition inspections  
- price/wage fairness reviews  
- rights audits  
- independent monitoring bodies with authority to mandate changes

Oversight must include:
- periodic review of job types, wages, prices, and vendor arrangements to certify they remain within moral and “reasonable work” constraints
- mandatory review of any death or serious harm plausibly linked to non‑engagement in the micro‑economy, to examine:
  - competence at the time
  - availability of at least one viable, moral survival path and charity channels
  - any architectural, policy, or market failures

Oversight bodies must be empowered to require remedial changes where failures are found.

---

## 11. Prohibited Practices
Corrections may not:
- impose labour requirements  
- manipulate market conditions to coerce labour  
- extract net profit from prisoner labour or essentials  
- introduce additional punishment beyond confinement and explicit derogations  
- restrict access to moral job opportunities as leverage  
- use deprivation or price manipulation to compel behaviour
