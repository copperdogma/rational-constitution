# Integrated Rationales (Corrections Layer)

These rationales justify the **corrections‑level** micro‑market, operational, and oversight design.  
They correspond to the same numbering used in the integrated additions.

## 1. Rights continuity — Corrections Implementation

**Problem Exposed (Corrections View)**  
- The slogan “the only punishment is confinement” risked hiding operational drift:  
  - old or disabled prisoners appearing to be required to work just to eat;  
  - rights (benefits, healthcare, communication) quietly disappearing “by virtue of imprisonment”;  
  - corrections practice treating prisoners as a lesser rights class even if the law did not say so.  

**Resolution (Corrections Duties)**  
- Make it part of corrections’ mandate to *implement* explicit rights continuity:  
  - preserve access to work, wages, spending, and social‑program benefits unless a right is expressly derogated;  
  - avoid creating implicit derogations via operational rules or convenience.  

**Key Arguments / Tradeoffs**  
- This keeps corrections from becoming a shadow law‑maker: practice must follow the justice architecture rather than inventing a second regime.  
- It ties the internal environment to **general, publicly knowable rules**: citizens act under a predictable legal order, with predefined punishment modalities and confinement structures, so entering prison is not an arbitrary surprise but the result of known consequences.  
- Within that known environment, the state supplies minimal moral conditions and the prisoner retains agency over whether to use them, which justifies treating refusal to engage a viable survival path as a self‑authored outcome rather than state‑caused harm.  
- Tradeoff: some operational flexibility is sacrificed, but in exchange the system gains clarity, legitimacy, and a clean agency/coercion story.

## 2. Closed-world moral micro-market & architectural duties

**Problem Exposed**  
- In a closed environment, the jailer designs the system that controls access to work and essentials.  
- Without explicit constraints, “work for essentials” can collapse into:  
  - forced labour (if jobs are degrading or wages are too low),  
  - structural starvation (if even full participation cannot cover basics),  
  - state‑profit slavery (if the state skims surplus from captive labour).  
- The claim “this is just the same social contract in a smaller box” holds only if the internal economy is genuinely moral and non‑exploitative.

**Resolution (Corrections Rules)**  
- Define a “moral micro‑market” with hard requirements:  
  - at least one morally reasonable job for every work‑capable prisoner;  
  - work that a free citizen could reasonably accept (not degrading, abusive, or rights‑violating);  
  - wages and prices calibrated so that diligent work can reliably buy food, water, basic shelter, and basic clothing;  
  - no net profit extraction from prisoner labour beyond genuine cost recovery.  
- Add architectural duties:  
  - maintain a physically safe, non‑degrading facility;  
  - ensure essentials are always available at fair prices;  
  - if outside vendors/employers fail, the state (or contractor) acts as employer/supplier of last resort under the same constraints;  
  - forbid artificial scarcity or hidden manipulation of prices/jobs to increase leverage over prisoners.

**Key Arguments / Tradeoffs**  
- Locks in the conditions under which “provide value or go without” genuinely parallels the outside social contract, instead of disguising coercion.  
- Turns verbal assurances (“we won’t exploit them”) into enforceable structure and measurable tests.  
- Shows that a **single** moral job can be sufficient when:
  - the justness of confinement legitimizes the prisoner’s dependence on an internal system,
  - the monopolist (state or contractor) is structurally prohibited from exploiting that dependence (no profit extraction, no forced labour, no weaponization of essentials, no artificial scarcity),
  - the guaranteed job meaningfully mirrors the outside social contract: provide value → obtain essentials.  
- The moral safeguard is **viability, not variety**: additional job options or market channels may increase dignity or efficiency, but the ethical minimum is one stable, rights‑respecting survival path.  
- Regulatory difficulty is not a meaningful critique: a tiny, closed, state‑runnable market with a handful of vendors, job types, and fully logged transactions is **easier** to audit and tune than a national economy with thousands of firms and sectors.  
- Tradeoff: the prison cannot be run as a revenue centre; it becomes a break‑even civic function, and it must continually maintain both the viability of the single guaranteed path and the higher moral standards that its confined scale makes possible.

## 3. External resources & alternatives to state employment

**Problem Exposed**  
- If the state is the only employer and vendor, even a well‑behaved internal market carries monopoly power.  
- Critics worried that:  
  - being forced to work for the state to survive looks like state labour, not a neutral market;  
  - prisoners with savings, outside income, or charity support were pushed into work unnecessarily;  
  - cutting off outside economic links undermined claims of continuity with free citizenship.

**Resolution (Corrections Rules)**  
- Make it explicit that prisoners can meet their costs through:  
  - their own savings,  
  - lawful outside income,  
  - voluntary contributions from family, friends, charities, etc.  
- Allow alternatives to state employment where safely possible:  
  - vetted non‑state employers (firms, co‑ops, NGOs) under monitored conditions;  
  - internal enterprises not under exclusive state control, subject to the same moral‑work standards.  
- Preserve the state/contractor as employer of last resort, not employer of only resort.

**Key Arguments / Tradeoffs**  
- Keeps the system closer to a confined free society than to “state company town” dynamics.  
- Ensures a resourced prisoner is not pointlessly compelled into work, which would contradict “confinement is the punishment.”  
- Tradeoff: added complexity in security and compliance checks for external flows, but within a bounded administrative cost.

## 4. Non-weaponization of essentials & non-instrumental deprivation

**Problem Exposed**  
- Even with a fair market, whoever controls food/shelter pricing and access in a closed system has enormous leverage.  
- Without a bright line, administrators could:  
  - tweak wages or prices to punish behaviours,  
  - use rationing or “temporary” price hikes as de facto discipline,  
  - claim “it’s just the market” while weaponizing deprivation.

**Resolution (Corrections Rules)**  
- Codify that essentials and their pricing:  
  - cannot be modified as disciplinary measures;  
  - cannot be used to pressure prisoners into specific behaviours beyond the neutral “if you don’t provide value, we don’t give you things for free” baseline.  
- Limit discipline to:  
  - non‑essential privileges (recreation, entertainment, extras),  
  - proportionate segregation for safety,  
  - other rights‑compatible tools that do not touch the basic value‑for‑essentials structure.

**Key Arguments / Tradeoffs**  
- Preserves the crucial distinction between:  
  - permitted consequences of a prisoner’s refusal to engage, and  
  - forbidden patterns where the institution rigs the environment to turn deprivation into punishment.  
- Protects the defender’s strongest line: deprivation is never used by the state as a tool; it is only the consequence of honouring the same social contract that free citizens face.  
- Tradeoff: administrators lose a powerful lever, but one that was central to slavery/abuse critiques.

## 5. No death-traps & guaranteed viable survival paths — Corrections Component

**Problem Exposed**  
- The defence “if you want to live, there is a viable, moral path” assumes that, in practice:  
  - at least one live survival path always exists, and  
  - that path is not blocked by pricing, job design, or administrative rules.  
- Without explicit safeguards, the system could drift into:  
  - jobs that exist on paper but are effectively inaccessible,  
  - wage/price levels where you cannot stay fed and sheltered even with effort,  
  - configurations where “work for essentials” is impossible in practice but legal in form.

**Resolution (Corrections Design)**  
- Require that, at all times, corrections maintain:  
  - at least one viable, moral job allowing survival for any competent, willing prisoner;  
  - functioning charity channels subject only to security screening;  
  - fair wages/prices calibrated to protect viability.  
- Forbid rules, vendor practices, or pricing policies that make survival impossible in principle for a competent prisoner willing to work.

**Key Arguments / Tradeoffs**  
- Operationalizes the no‑death‑traps justice axiom into concrete design constraints.  
- Gives inspectors a clear question: “Was there, in fact, a doable survival path for a minimally diligent, competent prisoner?”  
- Clarifies that, when a viable path, fair prices, outside support, and non‑weaponization are all in place, starvation or deprivation by a competent prisoner’s refusal to engage is a **self‑authored choice**, just as it would be for a free citizen.  
- Tradeoff: requires ongoing monitoring and recalibration but keeps the model aligned with non‑coercion claims.

## 6. Competence, capacity, mental health — Corrections Implementation

**Problem Exposed**  
- Without operational rules, staff may treat all refusals as autonomous, or override all refusals out of caution.  
- Hard cases (severe mental illness, dementia, acute crisis) require a structured response to avoid both neglect and overreach.

**Resolution (Corrections Duties)**  
- Operationalize the justice‑level capacity framework by:  
  - implementing capacity assessments in practice;  
  - coordinating with health and mental‑health professionals;  
  - putting custodial duties (feeding, medical care, safe housing) into standard operating procedures for incapacitated prisoners;  
  - documenting and regularly reviewing capacity determinations in cases of self‑endangerment.

**Key Arguments / Tradeoffs**  
- Ensures that frontline operations respect both agency and vulnerability, instead of relying on ad hoc staff judgment.  
- Tradeoff: requires training, documentation, and clinical input, but reduces moral and legal risk.

## 7. Market oversight, moral review & deaths-from-non-engagement review — Corrections Implementation

**Problem Exposed**  
- On paper, rules can be satisfied while practice drifts into:  
  - exploitative job mixes,  
  - wage/price imbalances,  
  - subtle barriers to charity or outside income,  
  - de facto death‑traps.  
- Without structured oversight and mandatory reviews, systemic failures remain invisible until scandal.

**Resolution (Corrections Oversight Duties)**  
- Provide operational access and data to the independent oversight body to:  
  - audit jobs, wages, prices, vendors, and rules;  
  - certify that “moral micro‑market” constraints are met;  
  - require changes where arrangements drift into exploitation or hidden coercion.  
- Require that any death or serious harm plausibly linked to non‑engagement with the micro‑economy triggers a formal review asking:  
  - Was the prisoner competent?  
  - Did a live, moral survival path exist?  
  - Were charity/outside support channels genuinely available?  
  - Did any policy, pricing, or market failure contribute?  
- Empower the review process to mandate remedial changes and track implementation.

**Key Arguments / Tradeoffs**  
- Provides the procedural backbone for all earlier guarantees: moral micro‑market, non‑weaponization, and no‑death‑traps.  
- Prevents the system from quietly devolving into the structures (coercive labour, starvation threats) it was designed to avoid.  
- Tradeoff: ongoing institutional cost and transparency obligations, but necessary for credibility.

## 8. Labour-for-essentials mirrors the social contract

**Problem Exposed**  
- Critics argued that “choosing to make prisoners work for food is immoral,” treating the labour‑for‑necessities rule as a special burden imposed only on prisoners.  
- That objection would be valid if:
  - wider society did **not** require labour (or equivalent contribution) for essentials, or
  - prisoners were being held to a different moral standard than free citizens.

**Resolution (Moral Rationale)**  
- Under this framework, the labour‑for‑essentials rule is the existing social contract:  
  - free citizens must provide value to obtain essentials;  
  - prisoners retain that same obligation and agency, with the state merely providing a minimally moral job and micro‑market because confinement removes access to the outside market.  
- The requirement to provide value in exchange for essentials is therefore **not** a new punishment; it is continuity with the background norm that applies to everyone.  
- If society later abandons labour‑for‑essentials (e.g. through post‑scarcity, UBI, or free essentials), the prison must automatically track that norm.  
  - Requiring labour for essentials when the free population does not would turn work into an additional punishment and would need explicit justification in sentencing.

**Key Arguments / Tradeoffs**  
- Clarifies that labour‑for‑necessities is morally legitimate only while it mirrors the external social contract; it ceases to be neutral if society itself moves to non‑labour provision of essentials.  
- Ensures the punishment remains confinement (plus explicitly enumerated derogations), not deprivation or forced labour.  
- Tradeoff: the internal economic design must be recalibrated if the outside social contract changes, but this is a necessary consequence of rights continuity.
