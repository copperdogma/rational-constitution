# ADR-0008: Fiscal Structure Based on Mandate Pools
Status: Accepted  
Date: 2025-11-11

## Context
Traditional budgets suffer from opacity, lobbying, and political favoritism. The new system requires predictable, citizen-aligned funding flows.

## Decision
Implement **Mandate-Based Budget Pools** with fixed ratios:

- Foundational (permanent infrastructure, safety, defense)  
- Strategic (evolving goals, revised every six years)  
- Civic Funding (innovation pilots)  
- Emergency Reserve  
- Administrative Cap (≤2%)

## Rationale
- Stabilizes funding while allowing adaptive priorities.  
- Creates direct link between citizen intent and fiscal allocation.  
- Prevents overspending and bureaucratic inflation.  

## Alternatives Considered
1. Annual legislative budgets — rejected (political manipulation).  
2. Fully automated tax allocation — rejected (too volatile).  
3. Central planning — rejected (inefficient, corruption-prone).  

## Consequences
- Fiscal transparency and predictability.  
- Citizens see direct impact of votes.  
- Requires regular recalibration to GDP and inflation.

- **Civic Mandate Economy Act**, §6.  
- **Externality Pricing Act**, for revenue integration.
