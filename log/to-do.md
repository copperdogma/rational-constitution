# To Do

**Contains both to-do items and outstanding questions.**



- [ ] Selling it: The idea of voting on outcomes and having AI learn your values and vote on your behalf may sound very strange but we can compare it to the world before democracy in countries that had never heard of it before. They'd always been ruled by an emperor or king. How strange it must've sounded to them to say "would you like the ability to individually vote for who rules you?"

- [ ] Using your I = P/R intelligence model on governance structures
	— Show how institutional design increases or decreases system intelligence
	— How predictability and resource efficiency define political “IQ”
	— How better gradients increase I by reducing R

- [ ] Society gets richer via tech. So far we're maximizing freedom and agency but not incentivizing tech advancements. I defy anyone to prove the single most important reason by 1000x times over that humans thrive is technology. If that's true, and we want to shape the govt to maximize human thriving, it should by extension incentivize tech advancements. How do we do that? One possibiliy is the maxim that technology is held back only by bottlenecks, so combining maximum human agency with the systemic identification and removal of society-wide tech bottleneccks should supercharge tech advancements and therefore human thriving.

- [ ] Need to nail down voting. What ARE people voting for? Outcomes? Values? Policies? Where does the crowdsourcing models come in and why? Can people vote up AND down on things? Why or why not?
	- I think we should assume voting is anomymous, but let's think through why that might be the case. I can think of one reason: social pressure/cancel culture for both positive and negative action. Democracy works best when people feel free to vote their conscience without fear of social backlash, and anonymity solves that.

- [ ] Constitution executive action problem: instead of relying on executive judgement, if it’s not real-time, defer to the policymakers to compete for the best policy solution that suits the outcome. Policymakers are already incentivized to make the BEST policies without constraint so they’re free to mine public data, consult experts, etc. But perhaps a baseline (Wikipedia research) should be established in the domain in advance, possible for public perusal. This would efficiently create a context baseline useable to all policymakers as a starting point. Maybe incentivize them to make their further research part of the original wiki for the benefit of all.

-  [ ] Need strong anti-corruption laws in the constitution especially when anything is up to a person's decision like the executive branch or the policy judges

-  [ ] Power WILL attempt to change the government. Assuming a user-voted outcome system with a competition to design policy, where can power change the government? How do we prevent it?


- [ ] Do we need "freedom of movement"? Is freedom of action enough? Speech could fall under the same argument.

- [ ] Assume AI inbound: I like that the design is focused around human desire, and agency expressed via voting, and that the system of exection is all theoretically done by AI, although currently designed as if it won't be. It's a nice upgrade path.

- [ ] Executive actions/emergencies: Real-time things like diplomacy, emergencies, wars, etc move faster than even efficient direct democracy can reasonably handle, so we need this executive branch, albeit with extremely limited powers that are effectively those that can't reasonably be delegated to the people. But what about longer-term stratgies or decisions like vaccine mandates? This one is WAY more tricky...

- [ ] Ten Commandments structure? Could we have all rules be hierarchical? This helps toward the "rules must be understandable" axiom. If we have a basic set of values and rules that fit on a page or two, an average citizen could understand the system and just by following the top-level rules, likely never run afoul of the law. Each law MUST be a derivative of a top-level rule or it wouldn't be allowed. A consitition is sort of like this already, where any law can be judged unconstitutionally and therefore struck down. Although it could create big messes where a rule just cites half a dozen top-level rules in a hand-wavy way. Not that that's inherently bad (still abiding by the top-level rules), but it likely means they're difficult to understand and enforce.


- [ ] How do we balance democracy against ridiculous narratives, bad groupthink, flavour-of-the-month policies/favourites/etc? Yes there's the consitution, but a lot of things are consitutionally valid but still dumb and not in the long-term inerests of the people. And although we try to make the rules as human-understandable as possible, we can't do so with choices and unintended consequneces. Sometimes that's just an inherently complex reality and it may not be clear to people WHY something is bad now or that it's related to a pet policy. One thing we can do is mandate that policies have to be data-based. They can't optimize for something that's unmeasurable or not quantifiable. And should we mandate that the premise of the proposal be data-based as well? Challenged as a matter of cource? Required to have supporting data for any underlying assumptions? On the other hand we don't want to put up walls of complexity/difficulty/opacity that would prevent the average citizen from engaging. MAYBE we follow our own advice and don't regulate in advance of possible problems. Wait for them to arise and see how we can solve them. Maybe people DO understand the negative effects of a polcy and roll it back. The policmakers are already inventivized to make the best possible policy, EVEN if the outcome people want is against their best interests, so they have an incentive to understand and protecft against negative unintended consequneces. Ideally the system will innovate and self-heal if we set it up well enough in the first place.

- [ ] Can we have people specify their root values? My future-truested-perosnal-AI-agent takes care of this neatly, but how to get citizens to exporess their vaulues without that? Why would we want to? Could we use it as a "survey" to help optimize policy design?
    - Germane: my discussion on relatively fairness via "wealth" comparison: https://chatgpt.com/c/691dea36-d0a0-8330-8d75-20daafa113c8

- [ ] Could we create a "humility" mechanism to incentive taking ideas from ANYWHERE in the world as long as they work better? We'll already have neutered that somewhat via getting rid of tribalist politicians (taking a foreign idea is admitting defeat or weakness!), but people are people and national pride may foster the same belief, plus a technocratic drive for "not invented here" syndrome which needs to be overcome to get the best solution regardless of origin. I think the "kickstarter" approach to policy ideas, plus the internal competition between policymakers and the policychoosers to maximize society value may be enough to overcome this. Standing on national pride or "not invented here," will quickly fall to a policymaker who ignores that and choooses a far more efficient Chinese idea when it makes sense.

- [ ] Make this into a promt?
****

I want to discuss a topic for consideration. Do not automatically agree with me; help me test it, check the assumptions, think from first principles, ensure it's rationally and logically coherent, and ensure it's morally sound.

I then want to evaluate it it's a) _necessary_ to include (it may already exist or be covered in a different way), b) if not necessary, is it's cost/beneit ratio strong enough to make it a solid candidate for inclusion?

- [ ] How explicitly do we need to call out certain rights? For instance the free speech right is covered in "Information and Expression Clause" but state interference isn't really spelled out explicitly. Logically this isn't an issue, but in practice it may allow sneaky overrides of the right if not explicitly called out. Are certain rights important enough to be explicitly called out? Why or why not? I don't want to junk up the constitution or, worse, provide two different versions of the same right which gives rise to multiple interpretations and confusion including possible legal challenges.


- [ ] This is not really a "constitution," it's a full state government. And the suggested penal system is just once implementatin piece of a much larger system, most of which I haven't defined or thouht about at all. I'm more interested in exploring the aspected that I'm interested in or think I have a novel take on. Split it into folders apporpriately:

## Morality
- [ ] Jonathan Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA-rIEiCcM4
    The video's key insight is that liberals tend to emphasize Care and Fairness most strongly, while conservatives draw more evenly from all six foundations. Effective persuasion involves "moral reframing"—making your argument using the moral foundations that resonate most with your audience, rather than only the ones you personally find most compelling.

    1. **Care/Harm**
    The idea that we should be compassionate toward others and avoid causing harm. This foundation focuses on the suffering of people and protecting those who are vulnerable.

    2. **Fairness/Cheating**
    The principle that everyone should be treated equally and have equal rights, regardless of who they are. It's about justice and treating people the same.

    3. **Loyalty/Betrayal**
    Arguments about the strength and unity of a group or country. This foundation emphasizes devotion to one's team, nation, or community.

    4. **Authority/Subversion**
    The idea of giving proper respect to people and institutions in society that deserve it, such as honoring service members, first responders, or legitimate leadership.

    5. **Sanctity/Degradation**
    The concept of keeping things sacred, pure, or clean. This can apply to religious values, nature, or traditions that should be protected from contamination or desecration.

    6. **Liberty/Oppression**
    The value of being free from oppression and tyranny. This foundation focuses on protecting individual freedom and resisting domination.



---

1. **Judicial balance** — Should constitutional rights evolve via citizen referendum or remain static?  
2. **Military command** — How should emergency defense authority be structured under a limited executive?  
3. **Metric complexity** — How to ensure comprehensibility for the lay public?  
4. **Bureaucratic incentives** — How to avoid risk-averse stagnation among policymakers?  
5. **Local experimentation** — Should municipalities have independent Mandate systems?  
6. **Legacy institutions** — How to transition from political to mandate-based governance?  
7. **Cultural factors** — Would this model thrive universally, or only in high-trust societies?  
8. **Human psychology** — How to maintain meaning and identity when leadership is depersonalized?  
9. **Inter-Mandate conflicts** — What arbitration mechanisms are needed?  
10. **Technological transparency** — Could verifiable computation and cryptographic audits replace trust entirely?

- The mandate system removes an entire class of dark inventive: political power. Is there ANY left? Executive branch? Departments like the police or justice system? The chancellor? The policymakers? If so, how do we check and balance it or remove the incentive altogether?
  - Executive Council membership lacks measurable criteria (no audit metric for "nonpartisan experts" or selection/rotation cadence).
  - Define quantitative standards for Executive Council appointment, evaluation, and removal; ensure Civic Outcomes Ledger specifies governing body responsible for metric upkeep.

- AI: I do want to write this constitution assuming that AI doesn't exist but keep exploring how we could allow AI to exist within the framework or the possible benefits for instance you can massively ramp up the amount of triple verification and auditing and stuff like that automatic data collection with AI especially for things that would typically slow down government way too much like having auditing essentially that that would slow a lot of things to crawl so nothing would ever get done too much would be absorbed into bureaucracy but with AI it could be basically automatic

- Corporate checks and balances: Check my constitution to verify that there are proper checks on corporation so I'm not sure if that's explicit enough

- Pure Mandates: CAN pure mandates work with all the categories of legislation? How does it with with regular govt defines and health care and education and stuff ?

- Finish constitution (civic and mandates) and triple check for misaligned incentives. Core tenets: take into account human nature, directly vote for mandates, incentivize positively everywhere, harness natural incentives for positivity everywhere possible (eg free markets), radical transparency, checks and balances on power. Has this been tried? When/where/result? Is there anything (tech?) that kept it from being implemented in the past?


- There's always a breakover point within a mandate/policy where people actually need to execute, and within there you can get artistic taste, execution failure, running over budget, etc. Whose responsibility is that? How do we fairly audit policy result if the policy was in theory brilliant but executed extremely poorly though no fault of the policymaker?

- ### 3.2 Categories
    - **Foundational Mandates**: Permanent, essential state functions (defense, justice, public safety, infrastructure).  
    - **Strategic Mandates**: Evolving societal objectives (environmental quality, education, equality, innovation). Reviewed every six years.
    - Are those the right categories? How do we decide what's foundational vs strategic? Is there a better grouping? How do we ensure something like education/healthcare get eternal funding? Is there a foundational theory of thriving civilization we can lean on to identify these core pillars that, regardless of country or technology, are fundamental to a thriving citizenry?

- Investigate people like Larry Sharpe and his brand of extreme incentiveization and libertarianism. Is this a specific school of thought we can pull foundational ideas from? A lot of his very clever ideas are policy ideas and would simply be welcome to compete in the open policymaker competitions.

- Probably need a Technology Assumptions section. Do we assume blockchain exists? AI (and at what capabilities)? Universal computer/internet access? Digital identity? But I suppose these woulnd't be captured in the constitution, but rather in specific policies or acts that proscribe specific technologies or implementations.


- Are we missing any fundamental parts of a constitution?

- Would adopting a subsumption-based model for the constitution be a good idea? That's sort of how legal precidence, amendments, etc work already, but maybe if we think deeply about that mechanism and research it on the web we can find/create a brilliant core mechanism.

- Should major Acts include a published "Core Compliance Statement" in the Civic Outcomes Ledger? What threshold defines "major," and who verifies completeness?
- How do we phrase the Core in Article I to avoid redundancy with `IV. Economic Order` and `X. Transparency` while keeping it explicit and useful?
- Best placement for the Core: embedded under `I. Foundations` vs. a standalone article; any downstream effects on interpretation or numbering?

- Add a Bill of Rights — a core constitutional section that explicitly enumerates individual rights and freedoms
    - Include clear amendment mechanics — possibly modeled on a Swiss-style double-majority (citizens + sub-units) to evolve rights while preventing populist swings.
    - Rights must be explicit, rigid, and speech-protective, modeled closer to the U.S. First Amendment than the Canadian Charter.
    - Only allow narrow, objective carve-outs (incitement to imminent violence, true threats, defamation).
    - Prevent subjective limits such as offense or emotional harm from being used to restrict speech.
    - Courts interpret laws through the Core principles, ensuring power checks always trump convenience.
    - Consider graded penalties that restrict specific rights (e.g., travel, vote, bear arms) rather than automatic imprisonment, making justice proportional and rights-aware.



## Social Welfare
- Misfortune Insurance: Related to rights (a right TO insurance by the state).
  - Basic medical falls under this, I'd think, especially when it's catastrophic: accidents, illnesses, etc.
  - Slippery slope, though. What about the rest of Maslow's hierarchy? Why or why not? And what standard of misfortune do we use? Seems arbitrary. What if someone's face is burned. Do we owe them reconstructive surgery? How do we balance the cost/benefit of the care? Does society pay a million dollars to save someone from cancer? Ten million? 100m? A billion? Do we need a callous price set on lives or the quality thereof? That sounds horrible.

- Basic Needs: How do we balance what the state provides vs what people can provide for themselves?



- Balancing core pessimism on human nature: One of the core tenets is to assume human nature is selfish, error-prone, and corrupt. A cyncial read would say there's now way we can provide unemployment insurance because people will just game the system. How do we balance this? What about people who say they can't work because of subjective disability (mental anguish, pain that can't be measured, etc)? It's a perfect opening for bad actors to game the system, but 100% denying subjective reasons feels like a violation of human rights.

- Corpoate "rights"? Does this make any sense? I know very little about it but I suspect it's simply another example of crony capitalism and should have never existed.

- The right to arms and self-defence are tricky. I get why the US has it; their constituon was born of paranoia around power. And we want to enshrine that same assumption that everyone is a bad actor and protect against abuse at their hands. Arms is the ultimate safety net against abuse by the state. The last resort is always violence, and if they strip the ability for anyone to protect themselves, a bad state could easily become a totalitarian one. And if that's the reasoning, there is no reasonable limit on arms. If they're meant to fight the state in the worst case scenario but we limit the population to butter knives, that's the same as outlawing self-defence. But we ARE assuming people are going to be bad actors, which means we're potentially leting the worst people with the worst intentions have the most lethal weapons that can main/kill one or many people.
- And for self-defence, it seems like a liberty... If someone is attempting to do something bad to you, it's irrational to wait for the state to proect you. That could mean theft or death. I also don't mind the premise that if someone is trying to do something terrible to you, you're allowed to do something terrible back. It not only feels fair, but it discourages people from trying to do something terrible to you in the first place. But now you get into all sorts of issues with proprtionality and timeliness. If someone steals from me and I know where they are can I go get it? Can I fight them for it legally? Can I break into their car to get it? Their house? Can I stab them? Can I kill their dog while trying to retrieve my property? Man. This isn't easy.


- Consitutional Popularity/Wisdom balance: How do we balance these? People vote in their short-term interests and without a politician and the helm, how do we ensure the population isn't voting to lower their taxes to zero or the majority voting to repress minorities? Is it just the constitution, and leave it to policy creators to try to sell their vision of the future to people even if it costs in the short term? And the constituion could have spending limits and minimal budget requirements for each article so that the population can't vote to spend more than the constitution allows or massively underfund something that's essential?
- Similarly, there's benefit to foresight and wisdom. Perhaps the ideal thing to do is have everyone sacrifice to pour 25% of GDP into some new tech that will pay itself off 10x in 3 years, and it's very obviously and provably true to a select few people, but extremely difficult to explain or sell to the public. How do you ever get things like this done? China has a good system for this where they HAVE people looking out for the long-term interest of the state. MAYBE we can have another branch of policymakers specifically looking out for the long-term interest of the state. They only get X% of the budget and their policies are evaluated similiarly to any other policies for efficacy. But not we're back to "well who sets direction?" Do they ramp up for defence in response to an aggressive neighbour? Do they invest in oil production even though it's unpopular to ensure cheap abundant energy? Tricky. We're getting back into politics now.

- Innovation incentives: I think basically an exipring patent system. Combined with anti-monopoly legislation might cover it. Validate against this and see if there's antyhing in here that gives better insights for a better system: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4hZAMp25s4&t=602s -- Is there a better incentive-based system if we think from first principles? And ensure it would survive a post-scarcity world.
