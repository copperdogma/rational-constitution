# Project-Specific AI Prompts

Use this directory to store prompts, templates, and helper snippets that are unique to the Rational Constitution workflow. Treat it like tooling documentation: it guides AI assistants and human collaborators but never modifies governed texts directly.

Feel free to add folders as patterns emerge, keeping names lowercase and hyphenated. Update this README when you introduce a new convention so contributors know how to extend the collection.
