# The Externality Pricing Act
*(Implementing the Externality Principle of the Constitution)*

## 1. Purpose
To ensure that all activities which impose measurable costs upon others or upon shared commons internalize those costs through transparent, market-based mechanisms; and to return net proceeds to citizens or to the reduction of base taxes.

---

## 2. Core Mechanism
1. **Externality Definition**  
   An externality is any measurable, causally attributable harm or degradation imposed on others without consent.

2. **Pricing Requirement**  
   Activities producing externalities shall incur a charge proportional to their verified social cost.  
   Charges are levied at the point of greatest measurability and control, typically upstream in the production chain.

3. **Revenue Neutrality**  
   - All revenue collected under this Act shall first fund equal per-capita dividends to citizens.  
   - Any surplus shall automatically reduce baseline income, property, or consumption tax rates.  
   - No agency may retain or earmark these funds.

## 3. Institutions

### a. Externality Registry  
A public, continuously updated list of recognized externalities.  
- Entries must meet the *Rights & Evidence Test*: harm, attribution, measurability, proportionality, and reviewability.  
- Additions or removals require a double-majority public referendum.

### b. Metrics Board  
An independent, non-renewable-term body charged with:  
- Estimating social costs and setting transparent price paths.  
- Publishing methods, data, and uncertainty bounds.  
- Conducting periodic red-team audits and inviting external review.  

### c. Citizen Oversight  
Citizens may petition for review or propose new externalities for inclusion.  
Whistleblowers exposing manipulation or concealment receive statutory protection and proportional bounties.

## 4. Implementation Rules

1. **Sunset and Review**  
   Each externality price expires after ten years unless renewed following impact assessment.

2. **Dual-Channel Liability**  
   Costs are divided between producers (upstream) and consumers (downstream) to align incentives across the supply chain.

3. **Equity Safeguards**  
   Baseline allowances for essential consumption ensure progressivity.  
   Dividends are equal and universal.

4. **Trade Adjustment**  
   - Imports are charged according to their embedded externality intensity.  
   - Exports remain subject to domestic pricing; no rebates permitted.  
   - Trade agreements may align pricing standards among participating states.

## 5. Transparency and Enforcement
- All data, models, and revenue flows shall be publicly accessible in machine-readable form.  
- Tampering with meters, data, or reports constitutes a criminal offense.  
- Independent auditors, selected by lot, verify compliance annually.

---

## 6. Limits
- Externality revenue may not fund discretionary spending.  
- The number and scope of recognized externalities shall remain minimal and evidence-based.  
- Non-measurable or purely aesthetic matters fall outside this Act.

---

## 7. Effective Date and Review
This Act takes effect one year after passage.  
It shall undergo a comprehensive review every ten years to assess accuracy, equity, and public trust.
