# The Civic Funding Act
*(Implementing the Public Goods Principle of the Constitution)*

## 1. Purpose
To enable citizens to directly shape the nation’s positive development by allocating a portion of public funds toward broadly supported public goods and civic innovations, using transparent, participatory, and market-compatible mechanisms.

---

## 2. Core Mechanism

1. **Citizen Allocation Rights**  
   Every eligible citizen receives an equal, non-transferable endowment of *civic credits* each funding cycle.  
   Credits may be allocated to approved projects that serve the public good.

2. **Matching Funds**  
   Public funds shall match citizen allocations according to a *quadratic funding formula* or other transparent matching mechanism that amplifies broad support over concentrated wealth.

3. **Budget Share**  
   A fixed percentage of the national budget, not less than one percent and not more than five percent, shall be reserved for allocation under this Act.  
   The legislature may adjust this range by supermajority vote.

4. **Voluntary Contributions**  
   Citizens and organizations may contribute additional real funds to projects within this system; such contributions may qualify for tax deduction subject to law.

## 3. Institutions

### a. Civic Funding Board  
An independent, publicly accountable body responsible for:
- Managing the allocation platform and ensuring equal access.  
- Verifying project eligibility and compliance.  
- Publishing real-time funding data and audits.  
- Selecting independent verifiers for project outcomes.

### b. Project Eligibility  
Projects must:
- Provide a measurable or demonstrable public benefit.  
- Disclose full budgets, ownership, and deliverables.  
- Accept open auditing of performance and expenditure.  
- Fall outside the scope of core government obligations (e.g., defense, policing, courts).

### c. Identity Verification  
All participants must be verified citizens or residents to prevent duplication, automation, or external manipulation.

## 4. Allocation Process

1. **Proposal Submission**  
   Any qualified entity may propose a project meeting eligibility standards.  
   Proposals are published for open review before the allocation phase.

2. **Funding Round**  
   Citizens allocate their civic credits within a defined window each fiscal cycle.  
   Credits expire if unused.

3. **Matching and Distribution**  
   Matching funds are calculated automatically and disbursed upon verified project milestones.

4. **Outcome Verification**  
   Independent auditors or citizen juries validate project completion and impact.  
   Fraud or misrepresentation results in permanent disqualification and financial penalties.

---

## 5. Transparency and Oversight
- All proposals, contributions, matches, and outcomes are published in open, machine-readable form.  
- The Civic Funding Board operates under annual independent audit and full public scrutiny.  
- Whistleblowers exposing misuse or corruption are protected and rewarded.

## 6. Safeguards
1. **Core Services Exemption**  
   Essential state functions are excluded from this system to preserve stability.  
2. **Equity Protection**  
   The Civic Funding Board shall maintain thematic pools (e.g., science, culture, local infrastructure) to ensure diversity of funded outcomes.  
3. **Sunset and Review**  
   Each funded project must undergo post-completion review within three years to assess impact and public satisfaction.

---

## 7. Effective Date and Review
This Act shall take effect within one fiscal year of passage.  
It shall be reviewed every five years to ensure fairness, inclusivity, and efficiency.
