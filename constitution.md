# The Rational Constitution
-----------------------------------------------------------

### **Preamble**

Recognizing that humans act from self-interest, that power seeks concentration, and that competition and transparency turn vice into public good, the people establish this Constitution to secure liberty, prosperity, and justice through well-formed structure, not virtue.

#### Foundational Design Principles
1. Incentive‑compatible design — assume self‑interest; harness it toward public good.  
2. Distributed accountability — power diffused with checks, subsidiarity, and retroactive liability.  
3. Transparency by default — public information and decision‑making rationales are open by default; exceptions are narrow and time‑bound.  
4. Outcomes and evidence — citizens set goals; administration executes within law and metrics.  
5. Market test with priced externalities — use competitive mechanisms and price externalities where they best achieve goals.  

#### Interpretive Use
In cases of ambiguity, institutions shall prefer readings consistent with these Foundational Design Principles. They guide interpretation and amendment but are not, by themselves, grounds to invalidate law; compliance is ensured through the Civic Outcomes Ledger, audits, and processes defined by this Constitution and Acts. Acts and amendments shall be drafted to adhere to these Principles and interpreted to further them, consistent with Article IX.

### **I. Foundations**

These Foundations implement the Foundational Design Principles stated in the Preamble.

1. **Rule of Law** – No one is above or outside law. Rights and obligations apply equally to citizens, officials, and corporations.  
2. **Limited and Divided Power** – Legislative, executive, and judicial powers are separate, checking one another by design.  
3. **Open Governance** – Government data, finances, and deliberations are public unless disclosure endangers national security as defined by law.  
4. **Subsidiarity** – Decisions occur at the lowest effective level; higher authority acts only where coordination is necessary.

### **II. Representation and Elections**

1. **Legislature:** Mixed-Member Proportional system—half local districts, half proportional lists.  
2. **Executive:** The office of **Chancellor** shall replace prior executive models, as defined in Article VIII.  
3. **Judiciary:** Independent Constitutional Court with staggered, non-renewable terms, appointed by supermajority of the legislature.  
4. **Public Finance of Elections:** Campaigns funded from public grants; private donations capped and disclosed within 24 hours.  
5. **Lobbying Disclosure:** Every meeting, draft, or gift recorded on a public ledger within one day.

---

### **III. Money Firewall and Integrity**

1. **Blind Trusts:** Senior officials must place assets in managed trusts.  
2. **Cooling-Off Period:** Five years before and after public service for work in related industries.  
3. **Auditor-General, Anti-Corruption Agency, Citizen Grand Jury:** Three independent bodies with protected budgets, overlapping jurisdiction, and mutual oversight.  
4. **Public Contracts:** All bids, scoring, and performance results published online.  
5. **Personal Liability:** Officials or executives proven to abuse office or law lose all gains and face criminal penalty; willful misconduct is uninsured.

---

### **IV. Economic Order**

1. **Free and Competitive Markets:** The state shall neither own nor privilege enterprises except for public goods.  
2. **Automatic Antitrust Triggers:** Excessive concentration or cartel behavior invokes structural separation unless three-body oversight grants temporary waiver.  
3. **Labor Protections:** Collective bargaining, safety standards, and wage enforcement guaranteed; penalties automatic and escalating.  
4. **Property Rights and Contracts:** Secure, transparent, and enforceable by independent courts.  
5. **Taxation:** Broad base, low rates, simple code—income, consumption, and land value; deficits limited by debt-brake rule balanced over the cycle.  
6. **The Externality Principle**
   1. All activities that impose measurable costs upon others or the commons shall internalize those costs through transparent, market-based pricing.  
   2. Revenues so collected shall first return to citizens as equal dividends, with any surplus applied to reduce base taxes.  
   3. The legislature shall establish independent institutions to assess, price, and review externalities, ensuring fairness, adaptability, and neutrality.

---

### **V. Social and Environmental Guarantees**

1. **Catastrophic Health and Pension Systems** funded by mandatory, portable contributions.  
2. **Education Choice with Accountability:** Funds follow students; schools meet national competency standards.  
3. **Carbon and Pollution Pricing:** Uniform market-based charges rebated to citizens; automatic annual adjustment toward set targets.

---

### **VI. The Public Goods Principle**

A portion of public funds shall be allocated through open, participatory mechanisms that reward projects receiving broad citizen support.  
Every citizen shall have the right to direct a share of these funds toward public goods of demonstrated collective value.  
The legislature shall define the mechanisms for such allocation—whether through matching grants, quadratic funding, or other competitive methods—subject to transparency, audit, and equal access.

---

### **VII. Rights and Liberties**

Speech, press, assembly, belief, privacy, due process, property, equality before law.  
No prior restraint; surveillance and seizure only by judicial warrant.  
Civil forfeiture barred absent conviction.  
Torture, collective punishment, and indefinite detention prohibited.

---

### **VIII. Executive Power: The Chancellor and Council**

1. **Chancellor:** The people shall elect a Chancellor as Head of State and Chair of the Executive Council for a single, non-renewable eight-year term.  
   - Represents the nation in diplomacy and ceremonial affairs.  
   - Executes time-critical or classified matters under law.  
   - May not propose mandates, alter budgets, or appoint judges.  

2. **Executive Council:**  
   - Composed of nonpartisan experts overseeing Foundational Mandates.  
   - Emergency powers require two-thirds concurrence and immediate recording in the Civic Outcomes Ledger.  

3. **Retroactive Audit (30/60/90 Rule):**  
   - Summary disclosure within 30 days; full report within 60; audit and citizen review within 90.  

4. **Transparency:**  
   - All executive actions are logged in the Civic Outcomes Ledger, redacted only for national security with automatic five-year review.

---

### **IX. Judiciary**

1. **Jurisdiction:** Protects rights, legality, and due process; may not alter mandates or metrics except for rights violations.  
2. **Appointment:** Mixed peer-and-citizen commission; long, non-renewable terms; removal only for proven misconduct.  
3. **Judicial Nullification:** Requires two-thirds majority and public rationale. Non-rights nullifications may be overridden by referendum.

---

### **X. Transparency and Public Data Integrity**

1. **Civic Outcomes Ledger:** All government metrics, budgets, and performance data shall be permanently published in a machine-readable public ledger.  
2. **Open Data:** All government data, models, and reports shall be open by default; redactions limited and reviewed every five years.  
3. **Accountability Cycle:** Every branch shall undergo periodic review by independent auditors and citizen panels, with results published in the Ledger.

---

### **XI. Self-Correction and Adaptation**

1. **Sunset Clauses:** Major statutes expire after ten years unless renewed following public impact review.  
2. **Regulatory Budget:** Any new compliance burden must retire an old one of equal cost.  
3. **Red-Team Audits:** Periodic independent tests for capture or inefficiency; findings public.  
4. **Citizen Initiative and Recall:** Laws and officials subject to recall or repeal by super-majority petition.  
5. **Constitutional Amendment:** Requires two-thirds legislature plus majority in national referendum.

---

### **XII. Enforcement by Incentive**

1. **Whistleblower Bounties:** Citizens exposing corruption or fraud receive a portion of recovered funds.  
2. **Private Right of Action:** Any citizen or competitor may sue for antitrust, environmental, or labor violations; successful claimants recover costs.  
3. **Automatic Clawbacks:** Ill-gotten profits confiscated; executives personally liable.  
4. **Transparency as Default:** Concealment constitutes misconduct.

---

### **XIII. Balance of Fear and Ambition**

Power is divided so ambition counters ambition, and information flows so deceit carries risk.  
Profit, prestige, and competition remain lawful engines—but only within rules applied equally and publicly.  
Government’s role is to referee fairly, not to play.

---

### **XIV. Continuity**

This Constitution stands on the presumption that people will cheat, lie, seek status, and pursue advantage.  
By design, those impulses shall advance the common good or fail at their own expense.  
When virtue appears, it is welcome but unnecessary.
